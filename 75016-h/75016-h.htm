<p class='c008'>We certainly owe an apology to
our Greek ambassador. The nine
hundred and ninety-ninth edition of
a declamatory old play of Euripides,
cut and slashed into the most newfangled
propriety by some J. A. Hartung,
or other critical German, with a
tomahawk, is a phenomenon in the
literary world that can excite no attention;
but when a regularly built
living Greek comes forward in the
middle of this nineteenth century,
exactly four hundred years after the
last Byzantine chronicler had been
blown into the air by our brave allies
the Turks—and within the precincts
of the Red Lion Court, London—ἐν
τῇ ἀυλῇ τοῦ ἐρυθροῦ λέοντος—puts forth
a regularly built history of the Greek
Revolution of 1821, thereby claiming—not
without impudence, as some
think—a place on our classical shelves
alongside of Herodotus, Thucydides,
and Xenophon, and a great way above
Diodorus Siculus, and other such retailers
of venerable hearsay: this truly
is an event in the Greek world that
claims notice from the general reviewer
even more than from the professed
classical scholar. At the present moment,
particularly, one likes to see
what a living Greek, with a pen in his
hand, has to say for himself; his
language and his power of utterance
is an element in the great Turko-Russian
question that cannot be lost sight
of. Doubly welcome, therefore, is
this first instalment of Mr Tricoupi’s
long-expected history; and as it happens
opportunely that the most interesting
portion of Sir A. Alison’s third
volume is occupied with the same
theme, we eagerly seize the present
opportunity at once to acquit ourselves
of an old debt to our Hellenic ambassador,
and to thank Sir A. Alison for
the spirited, graphic, and thoroughly
sympathetic style in which he has presented
to the general English reader
the history of a bright period of Greek
history, which recent events have
somewhat tended to becloud. It is
not our intention on the present
occasion to attempt a sketch of
the strategetical movements of the
Greek war, 1821–6. A criticism of
these will be more opportune when
Mr Tricoupi shall have finished his
great work.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c007'><sup>[3]</sup></a> We shall rather confine
ourselves to bringing out a few salient
points of that great movement, which
may serve, by way of contrast or
similitude, to throw light on the very
significant struggle in which we are
now engaged. A single word, however,
in the first place, with regard to
the dialect in which Mr Tricoupi’s
work is written; as that is a point on
which all persons are not well informed,
and a point also by no means
unimportant in the decision of the
question,—<em>What are the hopes, prospects,
and capabilities of the living
race of Greeks?</em></p>

<p class='c009'>Now, with regard to this point, Mr
Tricoupi’s book furnishes the most
decided and convincing evidence that
the language of Aristotle and Plato
yet survives in a state of the most
perfect purity, the materials of which
it is composed being genuine Greek,
and the main difference between the
style of Tricoupi and that of Xenophon
consisting in the loss of a few superfluous
verbal flexions, and the adoption
of one or two new syntactical
forms to compensate for the loss—the
merest points of grammar, indeed, which
to a schoolmaster great in Attic forms
may appear mighty, but to the general
scholar, and the practical linguist, are
of no moment. A few such words of
Turkish extraction, as ζάμιον, <em>a mosque</em>;
φιρμάνιον, <em>a firman</em>; βεζιρης, <em>a vizier</em>;
γενίτσαρος, <em>a janizary</em>; ραγιάδης, <em>a
rajah</em>, so far from being any blot on
the purity of Mr Tricoupi’s Greek, do
in fact only prove his good sense; for
even the ancient Greeks, ultra-national
as they were in all their habits, never
scrupled to adopt a foreign word—such
as γάζα, παράδεισος, ἄγγαρος—when it
came in their way, just as we have
κοδράντης, κηνσος, σουδάριον, and a few
other Latinisms in the New Testament.
The fact is, that the modern
Greeks are rather to be blamed for
the affectation of extreme purity in
their style, than for any undue admixture
of foreign words, such as we find
by scores in every German newspaper.
But this is their affair. It is a vice
that leans to virtue’s side, and springs
manifestly from that strong and
obstinate vitality of race which has
survived the political revolutions of
nearly two thousand years; and a
vice, moreover, that may prove of the
utmost use to our young scholars, who
may have the sense and the enterprise
to turn it to practical account. For,
as the pure Greek of Mr Tricoupi’s
book is no private invention of his
own, but the very same dialect which
is at present used as an organ of intellectual
utterance by a large phalanx
of talented professors in the University
of Athens, and is in fact the language
of polite intercourse over the whole of
Greece, it follows that Greek, which
is at present almost universally studied
as a dead language, and that by a most
laborious and tedious process of grammatical
indoctrination, may be more
readily picked up, like German or
French, in the course of the living
practice of a few months. It is
worthy of serious consideration, indeed,
how far the progress of our
young men in an available knowledge
of the finest language of the world may
have been impeded by the perverse
methods of teachers who could not
speak, and who gave themselves no
concern to speak, the language which
they were teaching; who invented,
also, an arbitrary system of pronouncing
the language, which completely
separated them from the nation who
speak it. But this is a philological
matter on which we have no vocation
to enter here: we only drop a hint
for the wise, who are able to inquire
and to conclude for themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>We now proceed to business. There
are five points connected with the
late Greek Revolution which stand out
with a prominent interest at the present
moment.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>First</em>,—The character, conduct, and
position of <span class='sc'>Russia</span> at the outbreak of
the Revolution.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Second</em>,—The character and conduct
of the <span class='sc'>Turks</span> and the Turkish government,
as displayed by the manner in
which the revolt was met.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Third</em>,—The character, conduct,
and political significance of the <span class='sc'>Greek
people</span>, as exhibited during the five
years’ struggle.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fourth</em>,—The character, conduct,
and position of <span class='sc'>Russia</span>, as more fully
developed at the conclusion of the
struggle.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Fifth</em>,—The character, conduct, and
political significance of the <span class='sc'>Greek
people</span>, as exhibited since the battle
of Navarino and the establishment of
the existing Bavarian dynasty.</p>

<p class='c009'>On all these points we shall offer a
few remarks in the order in which
they are set down.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>First</em>,—As to the conduct of <span class='sc'>Russia</span>.
It is a remarkable fact, and very significant
of the nature of Russian influence
in Turkey, that the Greek
Revolution did not commence where
one might have expected it to commence,
in Greece proper—<em>i.e.</em>, the
mountainous strongholds of Acarnania
and the Peloponnesus—but in those
very Principalities where we are now
fighting, and where the Muscovites
are always intriguing. How was
this? Plainly because all those
Greeks who had for years been brewing
revolt in their ἑταιριαι, or secret
conspiracies, took it for granted that
on that nominally Turkish but really
Russian ground, Russia would at once
come forward and help them to kill—we
use the Imperial simile—the sick
old Infidel, who had been so long lying
with his diseased lumpish body on
the back of the Christian population;
and accordingly the man whom they
set up to raise the flag of Christian
insurrection on the banks of the
Pruth and the Sereth, was an officer
in the Russian service, Alexander
Ypsilanti by name; and the first thing
he did when he came forward as military
head of the revolt in the Principalities,
was to put forth a proclamation,
in which the Christian tribes of
Turkey were told that “<em>a great European
power</em>” might be depended on as
“<em>patronising the insurrection</em>”—ὁτι
μιά μεγάλη δύναμις τοῦς προστατευει.
Now, here was a lie to begin with, to
which perhaps the old <i><span lang="la">Græcia mendax</span></i>
may seem not inapplicable: but in
fact it was a most probable lie; and
if lies were at all justifiable, either on
principle or policy, at the opening
scene of a great war, certainly this
was the lie which at that time and
place looked most like the truth. But
it is a dangerous thing to raise warlike
enthusiasm at any time, especially
when an emperor is concerned, by
sounding statements not founded on
truth. Had the Czar been ever so
willing to assist the movement of the
Wallachian Greeks, and to lead his
victorious Cossacks, scarcely returned
from fair Paris, to magnificent Stamboul,
he could not but feel offended at
the unceremonious manner in which
his decision had been taken out of his
own mouth, and the absolute spontaneity
of an imperial ukase been
forestalled by a vagabond Greek captain.
But the Greeks were, from the
beginning, out of their reckoning in
supposing that the then Czar would,
as a matter of course, patronise their
insurrectionary movement against the
Turks. Alexander, though not naturally
a very bellicose person, had
already done as much for the territorial
aggrandisement of Russia as
would have contented the most warlike
of his predecessors. He had
rounded off the north-west corner of
his vast domain in the most neat and
dexterous way by the appropriation
of Finland in 1808; and he had profited
alike in the upshot by the friendship
of Napoleon at Tilsit in 1807,
and by his enmity at Moscow in 1812.
That he should enter upon a new, and
in all probability a severe contest with
another enemy, and put himself at the
head of a great insurrectionary movement,
disturbing all the peaceful relations
so recently established, and in
such friendly amity with the great
conservative powers at Paris and
Vienna, was a proceeding not to be
looked for from a moderate and a
prudent man. This the Greeks might
have known, had they not been befooled
by patriotic passion. A “<em>holy</em>
alliance” no doubt it was which, in
1815, the pious soul of the good Czar
had made with his brother kings; but
this “holiness” was either a mere fraternisation
of sentiment, too vague to
be of any practical force, or at best a religious
stamp placed upon a document,
the contents of which were essentially
political, and did not at all warrant
the expectation that the most Christian
crowned Allies should be called
upon to interfere in supporting every
revolt which Christian subjects in any
land might feel themselves called upon
to make against their traditional lords.
Then as to politics: Though Alexander
was a most kind-hearted, truly
popular, and very liberal sovereign,
and had made speeches at Paris, Warsaw,
and elsewhere, equal to anything
ever spouted by the present Majesty
of Prussia in his most liberal fits, yet
he was very little of a constitutionalist,
and not at all a democrat. From Laybach,
therefore, where he was when
the revolution broke out in March
1821, he gave his decision in the matter
of the Greek insurrection in the
following very remarkable words:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The motives of the Emperor are now
known, from the best of all sources, his
own words, in confidential conversation
with Mons. de Chateaubriand. ‘The time
is past,’ said he, ‘when there can be a
French, Russian, Prussian, or Austrian
policy. One only policy for the safety of
all can be admitted in common by all
people and all kings. It devolves on me
to show myself the first to be convinced
of the principles on which the Holy
Alliance is founded. An opportunity
presented itself on occasion of the insurrection
of the Greeks. Nothing certainly
could have been more for my interests,
those of my people, and the opinion of my
country, than a religious war against the
Turks; but I discerned in the <em>troubles of
the Peloponnesus the revolutionary mark.
From that moment I kept aloof from them.</em>
Nothing has been spared to turn me aside
from the Alliance; but in vain. My self-love
has been assailed, my prejudices
appealed to; but in vain. What need
have I for an extension of my empire?
Providence has not put under my orders
800,000 soldiers to satisfy my ambition,
but to protect religion, morality, and
justice, and to establish the principles of
order on which human society reposes.’
In pursuance of these principles, Count
Nesselrode declared officially that ‘his
Imperial Majesty could not regard the
enterprise of Ypsilanti as anything but
the effect of the exaltation which characterises
the present epoch, as well as of
the inexperience and levity of that young
man, whose name is ordered to be erased
from the Russian service.’ Orders were
at the same time sent to the imperial
forces on the Pruth and in the Black Sea
to observe the strictest neutrality.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The publication of this resolution
on the part of the Imperial government
effectually quashed the movement
in the Principalities; and poor
Ypsilanti, after a few awkward and
ill-managed plunges, was obliged to
back out of his position, and, leaving
“Olympian George,” and other sturdy
Greek mountaineers, in the lurch, seek
for refuge, and find a prison in Austria.
In this whole affair, however, though
the Greeks had shown themselves
very vain and foolish, no man can
deny that the Czar behaved with
great moderation—like a gentleman, in
fact, and a Christian, as he was—and
moreover, we must add, like a wise
politician. For we can scarcely agree
with some strong indications of feeling,
both in Tricoupi and in Sir Archibald
Alison,<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c007'><sup>[4]</sup></a> that any Christian power
would have been justified in supporting
a revolt of Christian subjects
against their lawful sovereign, being
an Infidel, till these Christians had
first shown, by their own exertions,
that they were worthy of the intervention
which afterwards took place
in their favour. We see, also, that
Lord Aberdeen, in some late remarks
in the House of Lords, was quite
correct historically when he called
attention to the comparative “moderation”
of Russian counsels in some
of her dealings with Turkey. Russia,
in fact, never has displayed any very
flagrant rapacity in her dealings with
Turkey, for the best of all possible
reasons,—because, having as much of
the fox as of the bear in her nature,
she does not wish to alarm the
European powers on a point where
she knows they are peculiarly sensitive.
Her policy has been to poison
the sick old man, not to kill him; and
in this very moderation, as all the
world now knows, lies the peculiar
danger of her encroachments. Like a
deep swirling river, she rolls beneath
the fat mud-banks of your political
<span class='fss'>STATUS QUO</span>, and you suspect no harm,
and can walk on the green bank with
delectation; but when the flood comes,
there will be a shaking and a precipitation;
and then God help the
sleepers!</p>

<p class='c009'>So much for Russia. Our next
question relates to the Turks. How
did they behave at the outbreak of the
insurrection? The answer is given in
two words—like butchers, and like
blunderers. Like butchers in the first
place. Their way of crushing an insurrection
was truly a brutal one—πολιτική
θηριώδης as Mr Tricoupi
says; or shall we not rather say
devilish. Certainly Sylla, in his most
sanguinary humours, never enacted
anything more inhuman and more
diabolical than the wholesale massacre
of the prosperous Greeks in Scios,
April 1822, which, next to certain
scenes when the Furies were let loose
in France, forms the most bloody
page of modern history.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c007'><sup>[5]</sup></a> When a
Turk suspects a Greek of treason, he
makes short work of it: no forms of
law, no investigation, no trial, no
proof; but right on with the instinct
of a tiger, in the very simple and
effective old Oriental style,—“<em>Why
should this dead dog curse my lord the
king? let me go over, I pray thee, and
take off his head.</em>” So an old Jew
once said to King David; but Sultan
Mahmoud did not require that a word
of cursing should have been spoken.
Sufficient that the individual marked
for butchery stood in a prominent
situation, and was of the same brotherhood
as those who had spoken or
acted treason: if he was not guilty in
his own person, he was bound to be
cognisant of the guilt of others; and
for not revealing this guilt he must
die. Such is the simple theory on
which proceeded the wholesale murders
which took place at Constantinople
so soon as word was brought of
the insurrectionary movement in the
Principalities. As a specimen of these
infamous proceedings, we shall select
from Mr Tricoupi’s book the account
of the death of the Patriarch Gregory,
a murder committed with the most
flagrant disregard of all the forms of
justice (if there be such forms in
Turkey), and under circumstances
calculated to rouse to the utmost
pitch the spirit of the people whom it
was intended to crush; a murder,
therefore, not merely cruel and barbarous,
but stupid and impolitic. The
account given by our author of this
most characteristic event is somewhat
circumstantial, as might be expected
from the piety of a true Greek writing
on such a subject. We curtail it,
however, as little as possible,—especially
as the closing scene, in which
Russia appears a chief actor, affords
a vivid glimpse of the very natural
manner in which, unassisted by any
evil arts of diplomacy, that power
can continually earn for itself golden
opinions among the Christian nations
of the south.</p>

<p class='c009'>“On the evening of Easter Saturday,
or great Saturday—το μέγα σάββατον,
as the Greeks call it—being the
9th of March, there were seen dispersed
in the neighbourhood of the
Patriarch’s palace, within and without
the Fanar, about five thousand armed
Janizaries, without any person knowing
why. The Janizaries perambulated
the streets of the Fanar the
whole night, but did no harm to any
one. At midnight, as is the use in
our Church, the church-crier made
proclamation, and the Christian people,
though under great apprehensions,
immediately obeyed the sacred summons,
and assembled without hindrance
or disturbance in the church of
the Patriarchate. The Patriarch himself
officiated as usual, with twelve
other priests; and after the service
was finished, the people were dismissed,
and retired quietly to their
own homes. The Patriarch went to
his palace, when the first streaks
of day were beginning to appear; but
scarcely had he entered, when word
was brought that Staurakis Aristarches,
the great Interpreter, wished to
speak with him. The Patriarch proposed
to go with him to his private
room, but the Interpreter replied that
he preferred being taken immediately
to the great Hall of the Synod. There
he came with one of the Secretaries
of State, and forthwith produced a
firman, which he declared he had
orders to read aloud without a moment’s
delay in the presence of the
Patriarch, the chief priests, the heads
of the Greek people, and the deacons
of corporations. These parties were
sent for, and the firman instantly
read as follows: ‘Forasmuch as the
Patriarch Gregory has shown himself
unworthy of the patriarchal throne,
ungrateful to the Porte, and a deviser
of plots,—for these reasons he is deposed
from his office.’ The Patriarch,
accompanied by his faithful archdeacon,
was immediately led off to prison;
and as soon as he had left the hall, a
second firman was read out in the
following terms:  ‘Forasmuch as the
Sublime Porte does not desire to deprive
his faithful subjects of their
spiritual superintendence, he hereby
commands them to elect a patriarch
according to their ancient custom.’
A consultation immediately took place
among the clergy; and they agreed
that they should call to the patriarchal
throne Cyril, who had been formerly
patriarch, and was now in Adrianople;
but the secretary replied that this
could not be allowed, as the proposed
patriarch was absent, and under present
circumstances the Porte could
not allow the throne to be vacant for
a single hour; wherefore he commanded
them instantly to make election
of a new patriarch from the number
of the clergy then present. Another
consultation immediately took place;
and after considerable difficulty the
vote fell upon Peisidias Eugenios, who,
according to usage, was immediately
sent to the Porte, the rest remaining
till he should return. After three
hours he appeared, environed with a
pomp and circumstance more magnificent
than usual.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This ceremony of electing the new
pontiff was still going on, when Gregory
was led out of prison, where he
had been preparing himself by constant
prayer for the death which he
had too good reason for supposing was
prepared for him. After taking him
from the prison, they put him into a
boat, and disembarked him on the
strand of the Fanar. There the venerable
old man, looking up steadfastly
to heaven,<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c007'><sup>[6]</sup></a> made the sign of the cross,
and knelt down, and inclined his
hoary head to the executioner’s axe;
but the headsman ordered him to rise,
saying that here was not the place
where he was to be executed. They
accordingly led him into his own
palace, and there the executioner hung
him as he was praying on the threshold
of the principal entrance at the
hour of noon on Easter Sunday—so that
at the very moment when the wretched
Christians above were singing the
hymn of welcome to their new Patriarch,
with the accustomed words εις
πολλᾶ ἔτη δέσποτα, his predecessor was
hung on the ground-floor like a thief
and a malefactor; the very holy person
who only a few hours before had
offered the bloodless sacrifice for the
sins of the people, and had blessed
his faithful flock, who, with devoutness
and contrition of heart, had
kissed the hand that had been hallowed
by the handling of the holiest
elements. The last moments of Gregory
were moments of pure faith and
resignation, springing from an unspotted
conscience, a heart the fountain
of good deeds, a calm contempt
of this ephemeral life, and a bright
expectation of futurity. The writing
of condemnation, by virtue of which he
died, called, in Turkish, <em>Yiaftás</em>, was
fixed upon the dead body, and set forth
the causes of his death as follows.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here Mr Tricoupi gives the Turkish
act of condemnation at full length;
but the substance of it is contained in
two points: first, “that the Patriarch
did not use his spiritual weapons of
excommunication, &#38;c., against the
revolters; and, second, that he was
personally privy to the conspiracy.”
To which two charges the historian
answers shortly that the first is
directly contrary to the fact (for the
revolters were excommunicated by
the Greek hierarchy in the capital);
and with regard to the second, he
avers, that though it was quite impossible
for the head of the Greek
Church to be ignorant of the existence
of a conspiracy of which thousands
of the most notable Greeks in
Europe were members, yet he was
never a member of the secret societies,
and had, on the contrary, like
many other influential persons of his
nation, considered the movement premature,<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c007'><sup>[7]</sup></a>
and warned his countrymen
against it as likely to lead to the
most pernicious consequences. But
it is vain, as we already remarked,
to look for reasons that would
satisfy any European ideas of justice
in proceedings between Turks in
authority and rebellious Giaours.
The calm and solemn gentleman,
enveloped in smoke and coffee fumes,
whose bland dignity we so much
admired in time of peace, becomes
suddenly seized with a preternatural
fury when the scent of Greek blood
is in the gale. It is a primary law
of his religion, inherited from the
oldest Oriental theocracies, that no
infidel is entitled to live; and if the
head seems more serviceable for the
nonce than the capitation-tax, which
is its substitute, the law of the
Prophet is satisfied, and no man has
a right to complain. Mr Tricoupi
now proceeds with his narrative.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The execution being over, the great
interpreter, the secretary, and their
attendants, left the palace of the Patriarch.
In the evening of the same
day, Beterli Ali Pasha, who had recently
been appointed Grand Vizier, went
through the Fanar with only one attendant,
and, asking for a chair, sat
down for five or six minutes on the
street opposite the suspended body of
the Patriarch, looking at him, and
speaking to his attendant. After an
hour the Sultan himself passed the same
way, and cast his eye on the Patriarch.
The body remained suspended three
days; but on the fourth the hangman
took it down to throw it into the sea, it
being contrary to law in Turkey that
persons hung or beheaded should receive
burial. Then there came to the hangman
certain Jews, and having received
his permission (some say that they bribed
him), bound together the feet of the
corpse, and dragged it away to the
extreme end of the quay of the Fanar,
with mockery and blasphemous words.
Then they threw it into the sea, and
gave the end of the rope with which
they had bound the feet to the hangman,
who, having gone before, was waiting
them in a little boat. He immediately,
seizing the rope and dragging the body
after him, came to the middle of the
bay,<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c007'><sup>[8]</sup></a> and there attached to the body a
stone which he had brought with him in
order to sink it: but it proved not
weighty enough for this purpose; so he
left the corpse floating on the water,
and, making for the strand, came back
with two other stones, which he attached
to the body; and then, giving it two or
three stabs with his knife, to let out the
water, he immediately sunk it. After
some days, however, it came to the
surface at Galata between two ships
lying at the point where a great many
boats are always stationed, for passing
over to the city. One of these ships
was a Slavonian, and the other a Greek,
from Cephalonia. The captain of the
Slavonian saw the body first, and threw
some straw matting over it, with the
view of concealing it till the night, when
he meant to bury it, like a good Christian.
But when the evening came, the
Cephalonian captain anticipated him, and
perceiving from the unshaven chin that
it was the body of a priest, brought into
his ship secretly some Christians, who
assured him that it was the body of the
Patriarch. The pious Cephaliote immediately
swathed the body in a winding-sheet,
and, transporting it to Odessa,
deposited it in the Lazaretto there.<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c007'><sup>[9]</sup></a>
There the body was examined by the
order of the governor, and was recognised
by certain signs as that of the
Patriarch.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Information of this being sent to St
Petersburg, orders were given to bury
the body with all appropriate honours.
The sacred Russian synod came to assist
in the funeral ceremony; and on the 17th
of June there were assembled in the
Lazaretto all the local authorities, political
and military, the two metropolitan
bishops, Cyril of Silistria, and Gregory
of Hieropolis; also Demetrius, bishop of
Bender and Akerman, all the clergy
of the province, a great number of Greek
refugees, who had fled from the butchery
at Constantinople. Then the church
bells were rung, the funeral psalms were
sung, a salute of cannons was given, and,
with the accompaniment of military
music and the prayers of the congregated
faithful, the remains of the venerated
Patriarch were carried to the metropolitan
church of Odessa. Here they
remained three days, till the 19th, when
the burial-service was again sung, and a
funeral oration was pronounced by Constantine
Œconomos, preacher to the
Œcomenic Patriarchate, who happened
to be in Odessa; after which the body
was removed with great pomp to the
church of the Greeks, and deposited in a
new sepulchre within the railing of the
holy altar, at the north side of the holy
table, as being the body of a martyr.
And thus—to use the very words of the
semi-official journal of St Petersburg—by
the command of the most pious Autocrat
of all the Russians, Alexander I., were
rendered due honours of faith and love
to Gregory, the holy Patriarch of the
Eastern Orthodox Church of the Greeks,
who suffered a martyr’s death.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Next to the butchery—which, by
the way, the Greeks, as opportunity
offered, were not ashamed to retaliate—the
most noticeable thing in the
Turkish conduct of the war was their
extraordinary slowness, fickleness,
inefficiency, and bungling of every
sort. The insurrection, though attempted
in Thessaly and Macedonia,
did, in fact, never extend with any
permanent force beyond the narrow
boundaries of the present kingdom
of Greece, with the addition of Crete,
and one or two of the Ægean islands,
now in the possession of the Turks;
but to suppress this petty revolt of
an ill-peopled and divided district,
occupying a small corner of a vast
empire, all the strength of Turkey,
both Asiatic and European, proved in
vain; for it was not till Ibrahim
Pasha, in 1825, was sent by his
father, Mehemet Ali, with a large
Egyptian armament that the Morea
was recovered to the Sultan, and the
insurrection virtually quashed. Now,
when we consider that the Greeks of
the Morea were stamped with the servitude
of nearly four hundred years—that
they were, in fact, so awed by the
hereditary authority of their haughty
masters, that in the beginning of the
war, as Gordon expressly testifies,
three hundred of them could not be
made to stand against thirty Turks;
that their only effective leaders were
a few brigand chiefs from the wild
regions of Acarnania, Ætolia, and
Epirus; that the land was of such a
nature as to be kept in subjection by
fortresses, all of which were in the
possession of the lords of the soil;
that the sea was open to the men of
Stamboul as much as to those of
Hydra and to Mehemet Ali’s Egyptians,
we shall see plainly that nothing
but a wonderful combination of
slowness, stupidity, and cowardice on
the part of the Turks could have
allowed the Greek revolt to protract
its existence during the space of those
first four years, when—not without
large aids from English gold—it continued
to present a prosperous front
to the world. What strikes us most
in the account of the war given by
Gordon—who will always be a main
authority—is the great want of capacity
and enterprise in the Turkish
commanders both by sea and land—the
very same weakness, in fact,
which is remarked at the present hour
as afflicting the Turkish armies—a
want of good officers. There is in
Turkey a want of a high-minded, independent,
and energetic middle class,
without which an army never can be
well officered. Only one efficient
Turkish captain appeared in the
whole course of the Greek war; and
he took Missolonghi.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have been anxious to bring
forward this sad account of the conduct
of the Turks in the insurrection
distinctly, as there is a danger, at the
present moment, of the Turkish military
virtue being overrated. No man
who knew that nation ever doubted
that they could defend a fort well in
the present war, as they have ever
done where they happened to have a
good commander, and acted under
encouraging circumstances. This is
the secret of the recent successful defence
of Silistria, for which we feel
all respect. With the English and
French fleet to guard their flank, and
all Europe as spectators of their
mettle, with the very existence of
their empire perhaps at stake, and
with the choice of their own battlefield—that
is, the defence of forts—the
Turks would have been dull truly,
never to be roused, if the old heroism
had not flamed out with more than
wonted fierceness. But the successful
defence of this fort affords no proof
that the people who made it possess a
spirit and an organisation able to
cope in a continued campaign with
some Paskiewitch or Diebitch of the
next generation. Let us look to the
history of the Greek Revolution, and
not believe that the Turks are great
masters in the art of war till they
have successfully conducted a great
campaign. Above all things, matters
must be so arranged at the next
pacification that the preservation of
the peace of Europe may not be left
to depend on them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our third question has reference to
the Greeks. Their conduct in the
great revolt by which their independence
was ultimately achieved, deserves
to be noted with the greater
care at the present moment, because
there are not a few persons in this
country who are only too ready, in
the unhappy blunder of 1854, to forget
the glorious heroism of 1821–26. Sir
A. Alison, we are happy to say, with
that large spirit of appreciation for
which he is remarkable, has shown no
tendency to chime in with this vulgar
cry. He is not surprised that the
brigands of Thessaly and Epirus
should not possess all the virtues of
Pericles and Aristides; and therefore
he is not offended. The Greeks, in
fact, in 1821, were the authors of
their own liberty, as much as the
Turks now are the authors of the
retreat of the Russians from Silistria.
Most true it is, that without the intervention
of the Allied Powers, notwithstanding
their utmost efforts,
their cause was lost; so also will the
defence of Silistria have proved in
vain, if England and France, in the
proceedings that are yet waited for,
show weakness or vacillation. But
the Greeks, in 1821, had this decided
moral vantage-ground over the Turks
of the present day, that the intervention
would never have taken place
had it not been forced upon the great
Powers by the popular sympathy
which the heroism of the Greeks had
excited. We may say, upon a review
of the whole five years’ struggle, that
the Greeks displayed on that occasion
all the weakness, and indeed all the
vices, that belonged to a people just
rising from under the weight of centuries
of oppression—but virtues also
of the highest order, which it is of the
very nature of oppression to make a
people forget. Oppression, in fact,
had never done its perfect work with
this noble-spirited people; it had
made intriguers of those who remained
in the Fanar, and mere money-changers
and money-makers of those
who peopled the cities; the base
stamp of slavery also might be found
on the plains: but freedom remained
among the mountains; and in Maina
and Souli every brigand chief was a
hero. In fact, under such a military
despotism as that of Turkey, brigandage,
which is outlawed by a good
government, becomes the very church
militant of liberty. Whatsoever virtues,
therefore, belong to the indomitable
spirit of nationality when forced
to create its own law, and redeem
itself from destruction by the desperate
efforts of individual self-assertion,
belonged to the Greek people,
and those Albanian tribes who were
identified with them in the highest
degree. But there was more than
that. The Greeks, as the whole spirit
and tendency of Corai’s writings
show, were intellectually an advancing
people. They had scholars, and
thinkers, and poets among them, who
were fighting not merely for the rude
privilege of freedom—which a brute
can understand as well as a man—but
for the vindication of an intellectual
heritage of which they were
proud. To these men the possession
of the uncorrupted Greek tongue was
not a mere pretty plaything, as it may
be to many of our academical men;
but it was the badge which publicly
proclaimed their brotherhood with
that great hierarchy of intellect which
had conquered ancient Rome, and
inspired modern Europe. These men
did not fight with the mere impatient
spirit of vulgar insurrection: they
came, like banished kings, claiming a
long-lost throne; and Europe felt
that there was a dignity in their work
not belonging to every exile. But
there was another element of strength
in the Greek revolt, without which it
never could have succeeded, and an
element which, like their zeal for
intellectual culture, proved that the
modern Greeks are the true sons of
Themistocles and Pericles. This element
was their use of the sea. The
Turks, though they had possessed
the finest harbour in the world for
four centuries, though they governed
a country where arms of the sea
serve the same purpose that railroads
do elsewhere, had not only made no
progress in the nautical art, but had
allowed their enterprising slaves to
create for themselves a navy by which
they were to succeed in driving their
masters out of the field. When Ibrahim
Pasha, in his march across the
Morea in 1825, had arrived at that high
ground between Tripolizza and Argos
where the island of Hydra becomes
visible, pointing with his hand to that
little nest of daring adventurers, he
exclaimed, “<em>Thou</em> <span class='sc'>little England</span>,
<em>when shall I hold thee!</em>” This little
England it was which saved Greece.
There is nothing in the records of
modern history more interesting than
the dashing exploits of the gallant
Ipsariote Canaris with his fire-ships
in the Greek war; and wherever
Miaulis the Hydriote appeared with
his squadron, there everything that
could be done was done. But great
as were the exploits of the islanders,
Europe, perhaps, knew more, and
was justly more astonished at the
gallant conduct of the land army in
the two sieges of Missolonghi—a
fortress protected only by shallow
lagoons and a mud rampart, and
utterly unprovided with those long
lines of fire-spouting barricades that
make Cronstadt and Sevastopol so
difficult of approach. Yet Missolonghi
was maintained against the
whole force of the Turks for two
years; and when it did fall, the resolute
garrison made no capitulation,
but after having exhausted the last
scraps of raw hides and sea-weeds
which served them for food, cut their
way with gallant desperation, men
and women together, through the
sabred ranks of their enemies. Nor
were they without their reward. Let
Mr Alison speak:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thus fell Missolonghi; but its heroic
resistance had not been made in vain. It
laid the foundation of Greek independence;
for it preserved that blessing
during a period of despondence and doubt,
when its very existence had come to be
endangered. By drawing the whole forces
of the Ottoman empire upon themselves,
its heroic garrison allowed the nation to
remain undisturbed in other quarters, and
prevented the entire reduction of the
Morea, which was threatened during the
first moments of consternation consequent
on Ibrahim’s success. By holding out so
long, and with such resolute perseverance,
they not only inflicted a loss upon
the enemy greater than they themselves
experienced, but superior to the whole
garrison of the place put together. The
Western nations watched the struggle
with breathless interest; and when at last
it terminated in the daring sally, and the
cutting through of the enemy’s lines by a
body of intrepid men, fighting for themselves,
their wives, and children, the public
enthusiasm knew no bounds. It will
appear immediately that it was this warm
sympathy which mainly contributed to
the success of the Philhellenic societies
which had sprung up in every country of
Europe, and ultimately rendered public
opinion so strong as to lead to the treaty
of July, the battle of Navarino, and the
establishment of Greek independence.”</p>

<p class='c008'>On the other hand, we must not
shut our eyes to the faults of the
Greek people—which were, in fact,
just the faults of their ancestors made
more large and more prominent by
the long-continued action of circumstances
favourable to their development.
Will it be believed?—during
the time that this heroic struggle was
going on, by a people manifestly unable,
even with their strongest combined
exertions, to withstand their
gigantic adversary—even in the mid-heat
and the critical turning-point of
this grapple for free existence, the
Greek captains were quarrelling among
themselves! There were actually
at one time, as Gordon assures us,
seven civil wars among a people who
could only collect hundreds to plant
against the thousands of their masters!
Such a self-divided people, one
might almost say, was unworthy of
liberty. Certainly if they could not
agree to fight for themselves, it did
not seem the business either of France
or England to force them to be patriotic.
But, after all, what was
this but the natural result of the geography
of the country, and of the circumstances
under which its latent
liberty had been maintained? What
was it else but the same thing, on a
small scale, which the Peloponnesian
war exhibited on a large scale? Division
is the weak point of Greece, and
always was; and as for other vices
which stank so strongly in the nostrils
of some of our sentimental Philhellenes—cunning,
falsehood, selfishness,
rapacity, and blushless impudence of
all kinds—such rank weeds grow from
a neglected moral soil, not only in
Greece, but in the streets of London
and Edinburgh, and elsewhere; the
only difference being that in our case
a wicked or neglectful parent brings
up corrupt individuals, while in the
case of the modern Greeks, a wicked
and neglectful government had brought
up a corrupt people. There is, no
doubt, some truth in the doctrine of
races and hereditary propensities; and
the Greek may probably be more subtle
in speculation, and more cunning in
practice, than the other families of
the Indo-European stock. Nevertheless,
we are inclined to believe that
the proverbial falsehood of the Greeks,
which is the worst vice now continually
thrown in their teeth, is as much
the result of circumstances as of blood,
and that, under the same influences,
any Teutonic race whose honesty is
now most loudly bepraised, would exhibit
a large development of the same
vice. When a people is not allowed
to play the lion, it must either learn
to play the fox or perish.</p>

<p class='c009'>We shall now make a few remarks
on the fourth point stated—viz., the
circumstances attending the conclusion
of the war, as illustrative of the
policy of Russia. Here a very interesting
contrast immediately presents
itself. Alexander, as we have
seen, occupied with various benevolent
projects and perambulations, fearing
also not a little everything in the
shape of rebellion and revolution,
refused to have anything to do with
the Greek insurrection. In this he
behaved like a man, a gentleman, and
a king, but not like a Russian. As
a Russian he would have followed
the footsteps of Catherine, who twice,
in the latter half of the last century,
raised a rebellion in the Morea,
and assisted Greece not from any
classical enthusiasm, we may be sure,
(such as helped not a little to fan the
Greek fire of ourselves and the Germans),
but that she might cripple
Turkey by inflicting such a deep
wound on her left leg as would
render amputation necessary. All
this became plain in a few years.
Alexander died. In the year 1826
Nicholas succeeded; and matters were
at that period, by the fall of Missolonghi,
and Ibrahim Pasha’s occupation
of the Morea, brought to such a
pass that the bloody five years’
struggle, with all its heroism, must
have gone for nothing, had not the
tide of popular sympathy begun to
move so strongly in favour of intervention
among the great European
nations, that the governments were
forced to take the matter up. England,
as the most classical, and, may
we not say also, the most generous,
country in matters of international
feeling, was the first to make overtures
for a European demonstration in
favour of Greek independence; and
of the consulted Powers none came
forward with greater alacrity than the
new Emperor of the North. On the
invitation of the Duke of Wellington,
Nicholas was invited to send ships
into the Mediterranean to co-operate
with the fleets of France and England
in coercing the Porte. Here was
an opportunity thrown in his way, by
pure accident, to achieve in a few days
results more favourable to the most
cherished projects of Russian aggrandisement
than might have been
brought about by the tortuous diplomacy
and bloody encounters of long
years; and this not only without exciting
suspicion of ambitious views,
but amid acclamations, and cheers,
and philanthropic hurrahs innumerable.
By joining England and France
in establishing the independence of
Greece, the Czar felt that not only
would Turkey be reft of one of her
limbs, but a new field would be
opened for diplomatic intrigue in regions
hitherto preserved, by the blessings
of barbarism, from such refinements.
A little tinselled court at
Athens, with some German princeling
on the throne, was no doubt even then
seen in near vista, as the best possible
theatre for the display of those arts
of political falsehood and finesse in
which the Russian Nesselrodes and
Pozzo di Borgos excel. But more.
Might not the Turk, who is by no
means a milksop, and who can deal
heavy blows, as we have just seen,
even from his sick-bed—might not
the Turk oppose the armed intervention
of the Powers, and might not
some untoward collision be the result,
and might not the Turkish navy be
annihilated; and then—O! then,
might not the way to Constantinople
be more open, and the Balkan more
easily crossed? Such were the cogitations
that might naturally begin to
move in the brain of a thoroughly
Russian energetic and enterprising
young Czar, when the proposal was
made to coerce the Sultan into the
recognition of the total or partial independence
of one of his revolted provinces.
And the result, as we all
know, was exactly such as the most
brilliant imagination of a brisk young
emperor could have conceived. In
the course of a few months the Turkish
fleet was destroyed at Navarino;
in two years Kustendji and Varna,
and the whole sea-road to Stamboul,
were in the hands of the Russian fleet;
and in three years General Diebitch
had made himself immortal by surmounting
the unsurmountable Balkan,
and was resting with twenty thousand
men (supposed, however, to be sixty
thousand!) on the banks of the Hebrus
at Adrianople. Never was game
better played. The Turko-Russian
campaign of 1828–9, which we can
now study to such advantage, was, we
may say, impossible, but for the battle
of Navarino, which was only the natural
result of the armed intervention
of the three Powers in favour of
Greece. Add to this the disorganisation
of the Turkish army, caused by
the massacre of the Janizaries in
1826, and the consequent disaffection
among the old Turkish conservatives;
and we shall see at once how the
campaign of 1828–9 ended so gloriously
for Russia, while that of 1854
has proved so shameful. The cause
of the difference lies obviously in the
command of the Black Sea, which
Russia, by the disaster of Navarino,
then had, and which, by the Anglo-French
alliance, she now has not.
This, and this only, has on the present
occasion made the gallant defence
of a single fortress by the Turks equivalent
to the loss of a whole campaign
by the Russians.</p>

<p class='c009'>The last of our five points only remains—How
has the establishment
of Greek independence, by the treaty
of 1827, answered the expectations of
its founders?—What is the actual
state of Greece, material, moral, and
intellectual?—Are the Greeks under
German Otho substantially more prosperous
than they were under the
Turkish Mahmouds? We cannot, of
course, hope to answer these questions
satisfactorily within the limits at present
prescribed to us; but one or two
observations we are compelled to
make, for the sake of taming down
to somewhat of a more sober temper
the glowing observations with which
Sir Archibald Alison concludes his
fourteenth chapter. There is a class
of wise men in the world who show
their wisdom only in the negative way
of seeing difficulties and making objections.
Sir Archibald Alison certainly
does not belong to this class. Once
possessed by a grand idea, he marches
on fearlessly to its realisation, and
lets difficulties shift for themselves.
He gives you a project for a marble
palace and a granite bridge; but
seems to forget sometimes that there
are only bricks to build with. We
like this error, which leans to virtue’s
side, and has a savour of something
positive and productive; nevertheless
the truth must be spoken—for in politics
the best intentions are often the
mother of the greatest blunders. The
remarks of Sir Archibald Alison, which
we think require a little chastening,
are as follows:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“In truth, so far from the treaty of
6th July 1827 having been an unjustifiable
interference with the rights of the
Ottoman Government as an independent
power, it was just the reverse; and the
only thing to be regretted is that the
Christian powers did not interfere earlier
in the contest, and with far more extensive
views for the restoration of the Greek
empire. After the massacre of Chios, the
Turks had thrown themselves out of the
pale of civilisation: they had proved
themselves to be pirates, enemies of the
human race, and no longer entitled to
toleration from the European family. Expulsion
from Europe was the natural and
legitimate consequence of their flagrant
violation of its usages in war. Had this
been done in 1822—had the Congress of
Verona acceded to the prayers of the
Greeks, and restored the Christian empire
of the East under the guarantee of the
Allied Powers—what an ocean of blood
would have been dried up, what boundless
misery prevented, what prospects of
felicity to the human race opened! A
Christian monarchy often millions of souls,
with Constantinople for its capital, would,
ere this, have added a half to its population,
wealth, and all the elements of national
strength. The rapid growth, since
the Crescent was expelled from their territories,
of Servia, Greece, the Isles of the
Archipelago, Wallachia, and Moldavia,
and of the Christian inhabitants in all
parts of the country, proves what might
have been expected had all Turkey in
Europe been blessed by a similar liberation.
The fairest portion of Europe would
have been restored to the rule of religion,
liberty, and civilisation, and a barrier
erected by European freedom against
Asiatic despotism in the regions where it
was first successfully combated.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is the grand difficulty that now
surrounds the Eastern question, which
has rendered it all but insoluble even to
the most far-seeing statesman, and has
compelled the Western Powers, for their
own sake, to ally themselves with a state
which they would all gladly, were it
practicable without general danger, see
expelled from Europe? Is it not that
the Ottoman empire is the only barrier
which exists against the encroachments
of Russia, and that if it is destroyed the
independence of every European state is
endangered by the extension of the Muscovite
power from the Baltic to the
Mediterranean? All see the necessity of
this barrier, yet all are sensible of its
weakness, and feel that it is one which is
daily becoming more feeble, and must in
the progress of time be swept away. This
difficulty is entirely of our own creation;
it might have been obviated, and a firm
bulwark erected in the East, against
which all the surges of Muscovite ambition
would have beat in vain. Had the dictates
of humanity, justice, and policy been
listened to in 1822, and a <em>Christian</em> monarchy
been erected in European Turkey,
under the guarantee of Austria, France,
and England, the whole difficulties of the
Eastern Question would have been obviated,
and European independence would
have found an additional security in the
very quarter where it is now most seriously
menaced. Instead of the living
being allied to the dead, they would
have been linked to the living; and a
barrier against Eastern conquest erected
on the shores of the Hellespont, not with
the worn-out materials of Mahommedan
despotism, but with the rising energy of
Christian civilisation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But modern Turkey, it is said, is divided
by race, religion, and situation;
three-fourths of it are Christian, one-fourth
Mahommedan: there are six millions
of Slavonians, four millions of Bulgarians,
two millions and a half of Turks,
and only one million of Greeks;—how
can a united and powerful empire be
formed of such materials? Most true;
and in what state was Greece anterior to
the Persian invasion; Italy before the
Punic wars; England during the Heptarchy;
Spain in the time of the Moors;
France during its civil wars? Has the
existence of such apparently fatal elements
of division prevented these countries
from becoming the most renowned,
the most powerful, the most prosperous
communities upon earth? In truth, diversity
of race, so far from being an element
of weakness, is, when duly coerced,
the most prolific source of strength; it
is to the body politic what the intermixture
of soils is to the richness of the
earth. It is the meagreness of unmingled
race which is the real source of weakness;
for it leaves hereditary maladies unchanged,
hereditary defects unsupplied.
Witness the unchanging ferocity in every
age of the Ishmaelite, the irremediable
indolence of the Irish, the incurable arrogance
of the Turk; while the mingled
blood of the Briton, the Roman, the Saxon,
the Dane, and the Norman, has produced
the race to which is destined the
sceptre of half the globe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Such was the resurrection of Greece;
thus did old Hellas rise from the grave
of nations. Scorched by fire, riddled by
shot, baptised in blood, she emerged victorious
from the contest; she achieved
her independence because she proved herself
worthy of it; she was trained to
manhood in the only school of real improvement,
the school of suffering.
Twenty-five years have elapsed since
her independence was sealed by the
battle of Navarino, and already the
warmest hopes of her friends have been
realised. Her capital, Athens, now contains
thirty thousand inhabitants, quadruple
what it did when the contest terminated;
its commerce has doubled, and
all the signs of rapidly advancing prosperity
are to be seen on the land. The
inhabitants have increased fifty per cent;
they are now above seven hundred thousand,
but the fatal chasms produced by
the war, especially in the male population,
are still in a great measure unsupplied,
and vast tracts of fertile land,
spread with the bones of its defenders,
await in every part of the country the
robust arm of industry for their cultivation.
The Greeks, indeed, have not all
the virtues of freemen; perhaps they are
never destined to exhibit them. Like
the Muscovites, and from the same cause,
they are often cunning, fraudulent, deceitful;
slaves always are such; and a
nation is not crushed by a thousand years
of Byzantine despotism, and four hundred
of Mahommedan oppression, without
having some of the features of the servile
character impressed upon it. But they exhibit
also the cheering symptoms of social
improvement; they have proved they still
possess the qualities to which their ancestors’
greatness was owing. They are
lively, ardent, and persevering, passionately
desirous of knowledge, and indefatigable
in the pursuit of it. The whole
life which yet animates the Ottoman Empire
is owing to their intelligence and
activity. The stagnation of despotism is
unknown among them; if the union of civilisation
is unhappily equally unknown, that
is a virtue of the manhood, and not to be
looked for in the infancy of nations. The
consciousness of deficiencies is the first
step to their removal; the pride of barbarism,
the self-sufficiency of ignorance,
is the real bar to improvement; and a
nation which is capable of making the
efforts for improvement which the
Greeks are doing, if not in possession of
political greatness, is on the road to it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, to the first proposition contained
in the above remarks, that the
Great Powers were perfectly justified
in their intervention to save the Greeks
from the lawless ferocity of the Turks,
we have no objections to offer. It is
a gladdening thing to believe and to
see that the strong cry of human sympathy
will sometimes be listened to
even by politicians, and that heartless
diplomacy in the public intercourse
between people and people is
not all in all. But the summary expulsion
of the Turks from European
Turkey, even supposing it were
not too great a punishment for
the offence, would, when achieved,
leave the most difficult part of the
Greek problem unsolved. Sir Archibald
assumes that the discordant and
crude elements of which European
Turkey, less the Turks, is composed,
would, in 1827, have readily coalesced,
or is ready now, in 1854, to coalesce,
into a great Greek empire, of which
Constantinople shall be the capital.
That the Greeks themselves should
believe this is natural; that Sir Archibald
Alison should believe it, carried
away by a noble sympathy with a
heroic theme, is but the radiation of
that fire with which the noblest minds
burn most intensely; but we have
never conversed with an individual
practically conversant with the elements
of which Christian Turkey is
composed, who looked upon such a
consummation, in the present age at
least, as possible. A very intelligent
and patriotic Greek gentleman once remarked
in our hearing, that the Greek
kingdom could never prosper in its
present tiny dimensions; that the
Greek Islands—except Corcyra, which
the English must keep as a naval station—with
Thessaly, and part of Thrace
and Macedonia, must be added to it
before it could be free from that spirit
of petty intrigue which is the great
vice of small governments. This is
intelligible; because the population
included under such an extended Greek
kingdom would, by a great predominance
both of numbers and moral forces,
be essentially Greek. But when it is
proposed seriously to revive a Byzantine
empire, Greek merely in name,
and comprising such large sections of
a non-Hellenic population as Servia,
for instance, and Bulgaria, then, we
confess, we feel staggered; and all the
historic analogies which Sir Archibald
Alison so skilfully presses into his service
will not give wings to our drooping
faith. The best-instructed man
with whom we ever conversed on the
subject—Dr George Finlay, who has
lived among the Greeks all his life—declares
that such a combination is
impossible: the principle of cohesion
is too weak, that of repulsion too
strong: the splendid aggregate would
fall to pieces in a few years; and out
of the confused elements a new compulsory
crystallisation take place under
the influence—very likely—of
Russian polarity. Sir Archibald Alison
himself, in one of the phrases which
he accidentally drops, seems to admit
the truth of this view. “Diversity of
race,” he says, “so far from being an
element of weakness, is, <em>when duly
coerced</em>, the most prolific source of
strength.” Very true, when <em>duly
coerced</em>; but it is this very principle
of coercion that would not exist in
the supposed Byzantine empire; and
could exist only, according to one of
Sir A. Alison’s own analogies, through
the violent subjection of all the other
races by the one that happened to
be strongest; for so it was, as Livy
shows in bloody detail, that the different
races of Italy were coerced into a
grand national unity by the Roman
Latins. But even after all that bloody
cementing, the aggregate of the Italian
States, as no one knows better than
Sir Archibald Alison, was kept together
by the loosest possible cohesion;
as the terrible outburst of the Marsic
or Social war testifies, which well-nigh
split Italy into two, at a time
when Julius Cæsar, its future master,
had not yet begun to trim his beard.
He certainly, the lion, and his nephew
Augustus, the fox after him, did use
the bloody cement successfully, and
exercised a strong coercion, the effect
of which is visible even now among
the again-divided possessors of the
Italian soil; such a coercion as the
present Czar of Russia might perhaps
at the present moment be in the fair
way of exercising for the sake of the
Orthodox Church, had Sir Archibald
Alison’s Byzantine empire been patched
together with a few purple rags in
the year 1828. Or again, to take another
of his analogies, has Sir Archibald
Alison forgotten what was the
state of Greece, not anterior to, but
immediately after the Persian invasion?—did
it not plunge at once into
all the pettiness of provincial rivalry?
and was not the great Peloponnesian
war a speaking proof, that there
were no elements of cohesion even
among pure Greeks, and in the best
days of Greece, strong enough to keep
that unfortunate country from consuming
its own vitals in civil war, and
becoming, by voluntary self-betrayal,
first the scoff of the Persian, and
then the prey of the Macedonian?—With
these examples before us, we
cannot but consider ourselves more
near the truth in following the practical
statesmen who declared that the
new Greek kingdom should be confined
within the limits where the insurrection
had chiefly raged, and where
the battle had been fought. Sober
politicians could not but look upon the
whole affair as experimental; and
whatever arguments may in the course
of events be advanced for an expansion
of the limits of the existing monarchy,
no person practically acquainted
with the events of Greek government,
or rather <em>mis</em>government, since
the creation of Otho’s kingdom in
1832, can imagine that the evils under
which the country has groaned would
have been less, had Thessaly and Macedonia
been at that time included
within the Hellenic border. We
should still have had German bureaucracy,
French constitutionalism, Fanariete
intrigue, Ætolian brigandage,
and modern diplomacy, thrown together
to brew a devil’s soup of jobbery,
and falsehood, and feebleness,
over which the wisest man can only
hold up his hands, and with a hopeless
wonderment exclaim—</p>

      <div class='line'>Fire burn, and cauldron bubble!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In conclusion, we need hardly say
that we cannot agree with Sir A. Alison
when he states, so strongly as he does
in the last paragraph, that “<em>already
the warmest hopes of the friends of
Greece have been realised; and all the
signs of advancing prosperity are to be
seen in the land</em>.” It is a great mistake
to imagine that the country is
really in a prosperous state because
Athens has trebled its population in
thirty years. Athens has a well-furnished
and rather a flourishing appearance,
for the same reason that
Nauplia looks out upon the beautiful
Bay of Argos in such a state of woeful
dismantlement and dilapidation:
the court has left the Argive city, and
travelled to the Attic; and all the
gilded gingerbread, which you call
prosperity, has gone with it. Let no
man be hasty to draw sanguine promises
of Greek prosperity from anything
good or glittering that may delight
his eyes in the streets of Athens.
That splendid palace of the little German
prince, now called King of Greece,
with its fine well-watered gardens
without, and its fine pictures within,
and its large dancing-saloon, the wonder
even of London beauties—this
palace was a mere toy of the boy’s
poetical papa, and has no more to do
with the progress of real prosperity in
Greece than a wax-doll has to do with
life and organisation. Nay, it may
be most certainly affirmed, that not a
small part of that sudden growth of
the capital of Greece is, with reference
to the country at large, a positive evil,
a brilliant excrescence, which owes
its existence altogether to the artificial
attraction of the nutritive fluids of the
body politic to one prominent point,
while the largest and most useful
limbs are left without their natural
supply. If there are shining white
palaces, and green Venetian blinds,
in one Greek city, there is desolation
and dreariness, stagnation and every
sort of barbarism, in the fields. But
“commerce flourishes;” it has doubled,
says Sir A. Alison, since the battle
of Navarino. Be it so. Patras is a
goodly city, preferable, in some points,
to Athens, we think; but were there
not rich merchants at Hydra before
the Revolution? and are the Greeks
at Patras more prosperous than at
Salonica, at Odessa, at Trieste, at
Leghorn, at Manchester? There were
always clever merchants among the
Greeks, just as generally as there are
sharp bankers and money-changers
among Jews and Armenians.  We
would by no means despair of Young
Greece; there is much to admire in
her, especially her schools, university,
and the wonderful culture of her
deathless language in its most recent
shape; and only in a fit of foolish pettishness
would any Englishman entertain
the thought of blotting her
again out of the map of nations, for
any of the many sins she has committed,
whether by her own fault, or—what
we suspect to be the real truth—by
the ignorant and officious agency
of German bureaucratists, Anglo-French
constitutionalists, and Muscovite
diplomatists. Nevertheless, in
so slippery a science as politics, and
with creatures so difficult to manage
as human beings, it is always better to
avoid the temptation of drawing panoramic
pictures in rose colour; and
with regard to Greece, a country to
which humanity owes so much, our
first duty, in the present very critical
state of Europe, is to look soberly at
a reality full of perilous problems,
and to possess our souls in patience.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>STUDENT LIFE IN SCOTLAND.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>If the latest lingering summer tourist
in Scotland should perchance delay
his departure until he is driven southward
by the chill evenings of November,
he may chance to see arising
around him, in some considerable
town, a race of young men, whose
loose robes, varying from the brightest
of fresh scarlet to the sombrest hue
which years of bad usage can bestow
on that gay colour, attract him as
peculiar and funny, and as, on the
whole, a phenomenon provocative of
inquiry. He is told that the session
has begun, and these are the students
of the university. The information
will perhaps be surprising to him,
whoever he be: if he be an Oxonian
or Cantab, a sneer of derision will
perhaps curve his lips when he remembers
the gentleman commoners, and
tufted noblemen, who crowd the
streets of his Alma Mater in haughty
exclusiveness and unmeasured contempt
of the citizen class, who evidently
have no respect whatever for
the scarlet gown men of poor Scotland.
Indeed, the luxurious academic ease,
the placid repose of dignified scholarship,
are strangers to these wearers
of the flowing toga. It is evident that
many of them have felt the pinch of
poverty. No pliant gyp attends the
toilet, or lays forth the table for the
jovial “night-cap.” Hard work and
hard fare are their portion, and their
raiment shows that they have been
rubbed roughly against the world, instead
of being set apart from its toils
and cares and vulgar turmoil in aristocratic
isolation. Some of the gowns
are bright and new, indeed, and the
faces in which they culminate are
ruddy, fresh, and warm. Yet the
youths endowed in these blushing
honours seem not to exult therein,
but rather to give place to the hard-featured
brethren, whose threadbare
togas bear the grim marks of mud
and soot, or hang in tatters like a
beggar’s cloak. The truth is, that
the wear and tear of the gown is held
indicative of advancement in the academic
curriculum, and is rather encouraged
than avoided. And of those
who wear it, many, though they may
have been sufficiently tutored in the
economy of their more serviceable
clothing, have not made acquisitions
in the school of finery, or acquired a
weakness for decorative vanity. We
remember an instance of a hard-featured
mountaineer, who afterwards
rose to distinction in an abstruse department
of science, being charged by
his fellow-students with having so far
desecrated the gown as to have perambulated
the streets with a barrow
hawking potatoes, by the cry of “Taties—taties!”
He admitted the commercial
part of the charge, but denied
the admixture of potato-vender and
student by the desecration of the
robes. He was careful to put off his
gown while he cried “taties.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With all these and other indications
of poverty, there is something to our
eyes extremely interesting in the Scottish
universities, as relics preserved
through all changes in dynasties, constitutions,
and ecclesiastical polities,
through poverty, neglect, and enmity,
of the original characteristics of the
university system, as it existed in
all its grandeur of design in the middle
ages.</p>

<p class='c009'>A collection of remarkable papers,
now before us, opens up and presents,
in valuable and full light, the progress
of a portion of our Scottish universities.
They consist of two works of
that class commonly called “Club
Books.” The one is a collection of
records and other documents connected
with the University of Glasgow,
printed under the auspices of the Maitland
Club; the other a “Fasti Aberdonenses,”
appropriately collected by
that northern association which, in
honour of the Cavalier annalist of
“The Troubles,” is called the “Spalding
Club.” Both works are edited
with that peculiar archæological strictness
which has been applied to this
class of documents, through the special
skill of Mr Cosmo Innes. They
are both edited by him, with some
partial aid, in the case of the Glasgow
documents, from his ablest coadjutor
in Scottish archæology, Mr Joseph Robertson.
These volumes form a very
apt supplement to that collection of
ecclesiastical records which, arranged
and printed under the same able
management, are an honour to our
country. With the exception of their
curious and agreeable prefaces, neither
the chartularies nor the volumes before
us profess to be readable books.
They are collections of records, and
must have all the substantial dryness
of records. But then they contain in
themselves the materials of the social
and incidental history of the classes
of persons to which they refer, and
contain imbedded within them the
materials of instruction, both valuable
and curious. With some labour we
have driven shafts through their strata,
and we may have occasion to lay before
our readers a few of the specimens
we have excavated—confining ourselves,
in the mean time, to the characteristics
developed by the collection
of documents.</p>

<p class='c009'>The direction of these is chiefly to
show how thoroughly these remote
institutions partook in the great
system of the European universities,
and how many of its vestiges they
still retain. The forms, the nomenclature,
and the usages of the middle
ages are still preserved, though some
of them have naturally changed their
character with the shifting of the
times. Each university has still its
chancellor, and sometimes a high
State dignitary accepts of the office. It
was of old a very peculiar one, for it
was the link which allied the semi-republican
institutions of the universities
to the hierarchy of St Peter.
The bishop was almost invariably the
chancellor, unless the university were
subordinated to some great monastic
institution, when its head was the
chancellor—as in Paris the Prior of St
Genevieve exercised the high office.
In the Scottish universities the usual
Continental arrangement seems to
have been adopted prior to the Reformation—as
a matter of course, the
bishop was the chancellor.</p>

<p class='c009'>But while the institution was thus
connected through a high dignitary
with the Romish hierarchy, it possessed,
as a great literary community
with peculiar privileges, its own great
officer electively chosen for the preservation
of those privileges. It had
its rector, who, like the chief magistrate
of a municipal corporation, but
infinitely above him in the more illustrious
character of the functions for
which his constituents were incorporated,
stood forth as the head of his
republic, and its protector from the
invasions either of the subtle churchmen
or the grasping barons. The
rector, indeed, was the concentration
of that peculiar commonwealth which
the constitution of the ancient university
prescribed. Sir William Hamilton
has shown pretty clearly that,
in its original acceptation, the word
Universitas was applied, not to the
comprehensiveness of the studies, but
to that of the local and personal
expansion of the institution. The
university despised the bounds of provinces,
and even nations, and was a
place where ardent minds from all
parts of the world met to study together,
and impart to each other the
influence of collective intellect working
in combination and competition.
The constitution of the rectorship was
calculated to provide for the protection
of this universality, for the election
was managed by the procurators
or proctors of the nations or local
bodies into which the students were
divided, generally for the purpose of
neutralising the naturally superior
influence of the home students, and
keeping up the cosmopolitan character
imparted to the system by its enlightened
founders. Hence in Paris the
nations were France, Picardy, and
England, afterwards changed to Germany,
in which Scotland was included.
Glasgow is still divided into
four nations: the Natio Glottiana, or
Clydesdale, taken from the name
given to the river by Tacitus. In
the Natio Laudoniana were originally
included the rest of Scotland, but it
was found expedient to place the
English and the colonists within it;
while Albania, intended to include
Britain south of the Forth, has been
made rather inaptly the nation of the
foreigners. Rothesay, the fourth nation,
includes the extreme west of
Scotland and Ireland. In Aberdeen
there is a like division into Marenses,
or inhabitants of Mar, Angusiani or
men of Angus, which we believe includes
the whole world south of the
Grampians as the Angusiani, while
the northern districts are partitioned
into Buchanenses and Moravienses.</p>

<p class='c009'>The procurators of the nations were,
in the University of Paris, those high
authorities to whom, as far separated
from all sublunary influences, King
Henry of England proposed, in the
twelfth century, to refer his disputes
with the Papal power. In England they
are represented at the present day by
the formidable proctor, who is a
terror to evil-doers without being any
praise or protection to them that do
well. But it may safely be said that
the chubby youths who in Glasgow
and Aberdeen go through the annual
ceremony, as <i><span lang="la">procuratores nationum</span></i>,
of representing the votes of the nations
in the election of a rector, more
legitimately represent those procurators
of the thirteenth and fourteenth
century, who maintained the rights
of their respective nations in the great
intellectual republic called a Universitas.
The discovery, indeed, of this
latent power, long hidden, like some
palæontological fossil, under the pedagogical
innovations of modern days—which
tended to make the self-governing
institution a school ruled by
masters—created astonishment in all
quarters, even in those who found
themselves in possession of the privilege.
In Aberdeen especially, when
some mischievous antiquary maintained
that by the charter the election
of a lord rector lay with the students
themselves, the announcement
was received with derision by a discerning
public, and with a severe
frown, as a sort of seditious libel, enticing
the youth to rebellion, by the
indignant professors. But it turned
out to be absolutely true, however
astounding it might be to those who
are unacquainted with the early
history of universities, and think that
everything ancient must have been
tyrannical and hierarchical. The
young ones made a sort of saturnalia
of their fugitive power, while the professors
looked on as one may see a
solemn mastiff contemplate the gambols
of a litter of privileged spaniel
pups. The privilege was, however,
used effectively, we may say nobly.
There has been no fogyism, or adherence
to any settled routine of humdrum
respectability, in the selection
of the rectors. From Burke to Bulwer
Lytton and Macaulay, they have,
with a few exceptions, been men of
the first intellectual rank. What is a
still more remarkable result than that
they should often have been men of
genius, there is scarcely an instance
of a lord rector having been a clamorous
quack or a canting fanatic.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Edinburgh there is no such relic
of the ancient university commonwealth,
and the students have instinctively
supplied the want by
affiliating their voluntary societies,
and choosing a distinguished man to
be the president of the aggregate
group. The constitution of the College
of Edinburgh, indeed, was not
matured until after the old constitution
of the universities had suffered a
reaction, and, far from any new ones
being constructed on the old model,
the earlier universities with difficulty
preserved their constitution. Some
person called a College Bailie is the
dignitary who presides over the interests
of the University of Edinburgh
as one of the appendages of the Town
Council. By that body the greater
part of the patronage of the institution
is administered, and now it is
decided that they have the sole and
absolute right of making bye-laws for
the regulation of this, the leading
educational institution of Scotland.
There is something transcendently
ludicrous in a civic corporation—a
conclave of demure tradesmen, intensely
respectable—extending those
functions of administration which are
appropriately applicable to marketing
and street-cleaning to the direction
and adjustment of the highest ranges
of human instruction. Yet somehow
it has worked well, on account of the
very anomaly involved in it. The
town-councillors, in selecting a professor,
like the students in choosing a
rector, are afraid of their own powers,
and never venture to use their own
discretion. Absolutely ignorant of
the branches of knowledge to which
the rules they frame apply, they become
a medium through which these
rules are moulded by others, and a
certain commercial sagacity enables
them to divine who are the most
sagacious advisers. So also in the
exercise of their patronage, being
utterly unable to test the capacity of a
candidate, they dare not give way to
any partiality founded at least on this
ground, and they are generally acute
enough to find out who is most highly
estimated by those who are competent
to judge.</p>

<p class='c009'>That principle of internal self-action
and independence of the contemporary
constituted powers, of which
the rectorship and some other relics
remain to us at this day, is one of
the most remarkable, and in many
respects admirable, features in the
history of the middle ages. It is
involved in mysteries and contradictions
which one would be glad to see
unravelled by skilful and full inquirers.
Adapted to the service of
pure knowledge, and investing her
with absolute prerogatives, the system
was yet one of the creatures of
that Romish hierarchy, which at the
same time thought by other efforts
to circumscribe human inquiry, and
make it the servant of her own ambitious
efforts.</p>

<p class='c009'>It may help us in some measure to
the solution of the phenomenon to
remember that, however dim the light
of the Church may have shone, it
was yet the representative of the
intellectual system, and was in that
capacity carrying on a war with brute
force. Catholicism was the great
rival and controller of the feudal
strength and tyranny of the age—<i><span lang="la">informe
ingens cui lumen ademptum</span></i>.
As intellect and knowledge were the
weapons with which they encountered
the sightless colossus, it was believed
that the intellectual arsenals could not
be too extensive or complete—that
intellect could not be too richly cultivated.
Like many combatants, they
perhaps forgot future results in the
desire of immediate victory, and were
for the moment blind to the effect so
nervously apprehended by their successors,
that the light thus brought in
by them would illuminate the dark
corners of their own ecclesiastical
system, and lead the way to its fall.
Perhaps such hardy intellects as Abelard
or Aquinas may have anticipated
such a result from the stimulus
given by them to intellectual inquiry,
and may not have deeply lamented
the process.</p>

<p class='c009'>But however it came about—whether
in the blindness of all, or the
far-sightedness of some—the Church,
from the thirteenth to pretty far on
in the fifteenth century, encouraged
learning with a noble reliance and a
zealous energy which it would ill become
the present age to despise or
forget. And even if it should all
have proceeded from a blind confidence
that the Church placed on a
rock was unassailable, and that mere
human wisdom, even trained to the
utmost of its powers, was, after all,
to be nothing but her handmaiden,
let us respect this unconscious simplicity
which enabled the educational
institutions to be placed in so high
and trusted a position. The Church
supplied something then, indeed, which
we search after in vain in the present
day, and which we shall only achieve
by some great strides in academic
organisation, capable of supplying
from within what was then supplied
from without: and the quality thus
supplied was no less than that cosmopolitan
nature, which made the
university not merely parochial, or
merely national, but universal, as its
name denoted. The temporal prince
might endow the academy with lands
and riches, and might confer upon its
members honourable and lucrative
privileges, but it was to the head of
the one indivisible Church that the
power belonged of franking it all
over Christendom, and establishing
throughout the civilised world a free-masonry
of intellect, which made all
the universities, as it were, one great
corporation of the learned men of
the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>It must be admitted that we have
here one of those practical difficulties
which form the necessary price of the
freedom of Protestantism. When a
great portion of Europe was no longer
attached to Rome, the peculiar centralisation
of the educational systems
was broken up. The old universities,
indeed, retained their ancient
privileges in a traditional, if not a
practically legal shape, through Lutheranism
and Calvinism carrying the
characteristics of the abjured Romanism,
yet carrying them unscathed,
since they were protected from injury
and insult by the enlightened object
for which they were established and
endowed. When, however, in Protestant
countries, the old universities
became poor, or when a change of
condition demanded the foundation of
a new university, it was difficult to
restore anything so simple and grand
as that old community of privileges
which made the member of one university
a citizen of all others, according
to his rank, whether he were
laureated in Paris or distant Upsala—in
the gorgeous academies close to
the fostering influence of the Pope, or
in that humble edifice endowed after
the model of the University of Bologna,
in an obscure Scottish town
named Glasgow.</p>

<p class='c009'>The English universities, by their
great wealth and political influence,
were able to stand alone, neither giving
nor taking. Their Scottish contemporaries,
unable to fight a like
battle, have had reason to complain
of their ungenerous isolation; and as
children of the same parentage, and
differing only with their southern
neighbours in not having so much
worldly prosperity, it is natural that
they should look back with a sigh,
which even orthodox Presbyterianism
cannot suppress, to the time when the
universal mental sway of Rome, however
offensive it might be in its own
insolent supremacy, yet exercised that
high privilege of supereminent greatness
to level secondary inequalities,
and place those whom it favoured beyond
the reach of conventional humiliations.</p>

<p class='c009'>To keep up that characteristic
which the Popedom only offered,
the monarchs of the larger Protestant
states have endeavoured to apply the
incorporation principle to universities.
In small states and republics
the difficulty of obtaining a general
sanction to frank their honours to any
distance from the place where they
are given is still greater; yet it is in
such places that, through fortunate
coincidents, an academy sometimes
acquires a widespread reputation and
influence. To what eminence the
universities in the United States are
destined who shall predict? yet, in the
estimate of many, they have no right
to be called universities at all; and
of the doctors’ degrees which they
freely distribute in this country, much
doubt is entertained of the genuineness.
Yet if it would be difficult to
lay down how it is that these American
institutions have acquired any
power to grant degrees—that is to
say, the power not only to confer
prizes and rewards among their own
alumni, but to invest them with insignia
of literary rank current for
their value over the world—it would
be equally difficult for any of the
ancient universities in Protestant
states to claim an exclusive right to
such a power, since this could only be
done through Papal authority. It will
be said that there is just the same practical
difficulty in this as in all other
departments of human institutions, and
especially those which, like rank, are
transferable from country to country,
so as to require and obtain an estimate
of their value in each. It will
be said that the exclusiveness which
denies the Heidelberg Doctor of Philosophy
a parallel with the LL.D. of
Oxford is just the same as that which
will by no means admit the count or
baron who is deputy-assistant highways
controller, as on a par with an
earl or baron in the peerage of England.
The Kammer Junker of Denmark
is not looked on as a privy-councillor.
The Sheriff of Mecca, the
Sheriff of London, and the Sheriff of
Edinburgh, are three totally different
personages, and would feel very much
puzzled how to act if they were to
change places for a while. Some
Eastern dignitaries—Baboo, Fudky,
and the like, must occasionally puzzle
even the adepts of Leadenhall. Nor
are we without our instances near at
hand. What is the Knight of Kerry,
what the Captain of Clanranald,
what The Chisholm—and how do the
authorities at the Herald’s Office
deal with them? Has not an Archbishop
of York been suspected of
imposture in a Scottish bank when he
signed with the surname of Eborac;
and have not our Scottish judges, with
their strange-sounding peerage-titles,
made mighty confusion in respectable
English hotels, when my Lord Kames
is so intimate with Mrs Home, and
my Lord Auchinleck retires with Mrs
Boswell? But admitting the confusion
to be irremediable in the department
of political and decorative rank,
the absence of a uniform intellectual
hierarchy is not the less to be regretted,
while the great effort made to
secure it in an early and imperfect
condition of society should be contemplated
with a respectful awe.
There is just one man who professes
to be able effectually to restore it—the
sage of positivism, M. Comte; and
he is to do it when he has established
absolute science in everything, and
put down freedom of opinion by the
application of sure scientific deduction
in every department of the world’s
intellectual pursuits; when it shall
be as impossible to question the most
abstruse propositions in chemistry,
geology, or social organisation, as to
question the multiplication table or
the succession of the tides—then, indeed,
may absolute laws be laid down
to govern the world in its appreciation
of intellectual rank. But it is long yet
ere that day of certain knowledge—if it
is ever destined to dawn on that poor,
blundering, unfortunate fellow, man.
We have got but a very, very little
way yet, and we know not how much
farther it is permitted us to penetrate.
Terrible are the chaotic heaps that
have to be cleared away or set in
order by the pioneers of intellect, and
it is still a question whether our race
can provide those who are strong-headed
enough for the task.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is much truth, however, at
the foundation of the French sage’s
audacious speculations, that intellect
must achieve for herself her own conquests
and take her own position. In
the greatness of the acquirements of
which they are the nursery, must we
look hereafter to the greatness of our
seminaries of learning. If the university
is but a grammar school or a
collection of popular lecture-rooms,
no royal decrees or republican ordinances
will give it rank—if it be a
great centre of literary and scientific
illumination, the pride or enmity of its
rivals will not tarnish its lustre. But
apart from, the question between
catholicity and positivity, it is, we
think, very interesting to notice in
our universities—humble as we admit
them to be—the relics of the nomenclature
and customs which, in the
fifteenth century, marked their rank
in the great European cluster of universities.
The most eminent of their
characteristics is that high officer, the
Rector, already spoken of. There is
a Censor too—but for all the grandeur
of his etymological ancestry in Roman
history, he is but a small officer—in
stature sometimes, as well as dignity.
He calls over the catalogue or roll of
names, marking those absent—a duty
quite in keeping with that enumerating
function of the Roman officer
which has left to us the word census
as a numbering of the people.</p>

<p class='c009'>So lately as the eighteenth century,
when the monastic or collegiate
system which has now so totally disappeared
from the Scottish universities
yet lingered about them, the
censor was a more important, or at
least more laborious officer, and, oddly
enough, he corresponded in some measure
with the character into which,
in England, the Proctor had been so
strangely diverted. In a regulation
adopted in Glasgow, in 1725, it is provided
“that all students be obliged,
after the bells ring, immediately to
repair to their classes, and to keep
within them, and a censor be appointed
to every class, to attend from the
ringing of the bells till the several
masters come to their classes, and
observe any, either of his own class
or of any other, who shall be found
walking in the courts during the above
time, or standing on the stairs, or
looking out at the windows, or making
noise.”—<cite><span lang="la">Munimenta Univ. Glasguensis</span></cite>,
ii. 429. This has something of the
mere schoolroom characteristic of
our modern university discipline,
but this other paragraph, from the
same set of regulations, is indicative
both of more mature vices among the
precocious youth of Glasgow, and a
more inquisitorial corrective organisation:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“That for keeping order without
the College, a censor be appointed to
observe any who shall be in the streets
before the bells ring, and to go now
and then to the billiard-tables, and
to the other gaming-places, to observe
if any be playing at the times when
they ought to be in their chambers;
and that this censor be taken from
the poor scholars of the several classes
alternately, as they shall be thought
most fit for that office, and that some
reward be thought of for their pains.”
(<em>Ibid.</em>, 425). In the fierce street-conflicts,
to which we may have occasion
to refer, the poor censors had a more
perilous service.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the universities of Central
Europe, and that of Paris, their
parent, the censor was a very important
person; yet he was the subordinate
of one far greater in power
and influence. In the words of the
writers of the <cite>Trevaux</cite>, so full of
knowledge about such matters, “<span lang="fr">Un
Régent est dans sa classe comme un
Souverain; il crée des charges de
<em>Censeurs</em> comme il lui plait, il les
donne à qui il veut, et il les abolit
quand il le judge à propos.</span>” The
regents still exist in more than their
original potency; for they are that
essential invigorating element of the
university of the present day, without
which it would not exist. Of old,
when every magister was entitled to
teach in the university, the regents
were persons selected from among
them, with the powers of government
as separate from the capacity and
function of instructing; at present, in
so far as the university is a school, the
regent is a schoolmaster—and therefore,
as we have just said, he is an
essential element of the establishment.
The term regent, like most of the other
university distinctions, was originally
of Parisian nomenclature, and there
might be adduced a good deal of learning
bearing on its signification as distinct
from that of the word professor—now
so desecrated in its use that we
are most familiar with it in connection
with dancing-schools, jugglers’ booths,
and veterinary surgeries. The regency,
as a university distinction conferred
as a reward of capacities shown within
the arena of the university, and
judged of according to its republican
principles, seems to have lingered in a
rather confused shape in our Scottish
universities, and to have gradually
ingrafted itself on the patronage of
the professorships. So in reference to
Glasgow, immediately after the Revolution,
when there was a vacancy or
two from Episcopalians declining to
take the obligation to acknowledge
the new Church Establishment, there
appears the following notice:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>January 2, 1691.</em>—There had
never been so solemn and numerous
an appearance of disputants for a
regent’s place as was for fourteen
days before this, nine candidates
disputing; and in all their disputes
and other exercises they all behaved
themselves so well, as that the Faculty
judged there was not one of them but
gave such specimens of their learning
as might deserve the place, which
occasioned so great difficulty in the
choice that the Faculty, choosing a
leet of some of them who seemed
most to excel and be fittest, did determine
the same by lot, which the
Faculty did solemnly go about, and
the lot fell upon Mr John Law, who
thereupon was this day established
regent.”—<em>Ibid.</em>, vol. iii. p. 596.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sir William Hamilton explains the
position of the regents with a lucid
precision which makes his statement
correspond precisely with the documentary
stores before us. “In the
original constitution of Oxford,” he
says, “as in that of all the older
universities of the Parisian model,
the business of instruction was not
confided to a special body of privileged
professors. The University was
governed, the University was taught,
by the graduates at large. Professor,
master, doctor, were originally
synonymous. Every graduate
had an equal right of teaching publicly
in the University the subjects competent
to his faculty and to the rank of
his degree; nay, every graduate incurred
the obligation of teaching
publicly, for a certain period, the
subjects of his faculty—for such was
the condition involved in the grant of
the degree itself. The bachelor, or
imperfect graduate, partly as an exercise
towards the higher honour, and
useful to himself, partly as a performance
due for the degree obtained,
and of advantage to others, was
bound to read under a master or
doctor in his faculty a course of
lectures; and the master, doctor, or
perfect graduate, was in like manner,
after his promotion, obliged immediately
to commence (<i><span lang="la">incipere</span></i>), and to
continue for a certain period publicly
to teach (<i><span lang="la">regere</span></i>), some at least of the
subjects appertaining to his faculty.
As, however, it was only necessary
for the University to enforce this
obligation of public teaching, compulsory
on all graduates during the term
of their <em>necessary regency</em>, if there did
not come forward a competent number
of <em>voluntary regents</em> to execute this
function; and as the schools belonging
to the several faculties, and in
which alone all public or ordinary
instruction could be delivered, were
frequently inadequate to accommodate
the multitude of the inceptors, it came
to pass that in these universities the
original period of necessary regency
was once and again abbreviated, and
even a dispensation from actual teaching
during its continuance commonly
allowed. At the same time, as the
University only accomplished the end
of its existence through its regents,
they alone were allowed to enjoy full
privileges in its legislature and government;
they alone partook of its <i><span lang="la">beneficia</span></i>
and <i><span lang="la">sportulæ</span></i>. In Paris the non-regent
graduates were only assembled
on rare and extraordinary occasions:
in Oxford the regents constituted the
house of congregation, which, among
other exclusive prerogatives, was anciently
the initiatory assembly through
which it behoved that every measure
should pass before it could be admitted
to the house of convocation, composed
indifferently of all regents and
non-regents resident in the University.”—<cite>Dissertations</cite>,
p. 391–2.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the term Regent became afterwards
obsolete in the southern universities,
while it continued by usage
to be applied to a certain class of
professors in our own. Along with
other purely academic titles and functions,
it fell in England before the
rising ascendancy of the heads and
other functionaries of the collegiate
institutions—colleges, halls, inns, and
entries. So, in the same way, evaporated
the faculties and their deans,
still conspicuous in Scottish academic
nomenclature. In both quarters they
were derived from the all-fruitful nursery
of the Parisian University. But
Scotland kept and cherished what she
obtained from a friend and ally; England
despised and forgot the example
of an alien and hostile people. The
Decanus seems to have been a captain
or leader of ten—a sort of tything-man;
and Ducange speaks of him as a superintendent
of ten monks. He afterwards
came into general employment as a
sort of chairman and leader. The
<em>Doyens</em> of all sorts, lay and ecclesiastical,
were a marked feature of ancient
France, as they still are of Scotland,
where there is a large body of lay
deans, from the eminent lawyer who
presides over the Faculty of Advocates
down to “my feyther the deacon,”
who gathers behind a half-door
the gear that is to make his son a
capitalist and a magistrate. Among
the Scottish universities the deans of
faculty are still nearly as familiar a
title as they were at Paris or Bologna.</p>

<p class='c009'>The employment in the universities
of a dead language as the means of
communication was not only a natural
arrangement for teaching the familiar
use of that language, but it was also
evidently courted as one of the tokens
of learned isolation from the common
illiterate world. In Scotland, as perhaps
in some other small countries,
such as Holland, the Latin remained
as the language of literature after the
great nations England, France, Germany,
Italy, and Spain, were making
a vernacular literature for themselves.
In the seventeenth century the Scot
had not been reconciled to the acceptance
of the English tongue as his own;
nor, indeed, could he employ it either
gracefully or accurately. On the other
hand, he felt the provincialism of the
Lowland Scottish tongue, the ridicule
attached to its use in books which
happened to cross the Border, and the
narrowness of the field it afforded to
literary ambition.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hence every man who looked to be
a worker in literature or science, threw
himself into the academic practice of
cultivating the familiar use of the Latin
language. To the Scottish scholars
it was almost a revived language, and
they possessed as great a command
over it as can ever be obtained of a
language confined to a class, and not
universally used by the lowest as well
as the highest of the people. Hence,
when he had the pen in hand, the
educated Scotsman felt the Latin
come more naturally to his call than
the vernacular; and people accustomed
to rummage among old letters
by Scotsmen will have sometimes
noticed that the writer, beginning
with his native tongue, slips gradually
into the employment of Latin as a
relief, just as we may find a foreigner
abandon the arduous labour of breaking
English, to repose himself in the
easy fluency of his natural speech.
We believe that no language, employed
only by a class, is capable of
the same copiousness and flexibility
as that which is necessarily applicable
to all purposes, from the meanest
to the highest. But such as a
class-language could become, the Latin
was among the Scots; and it is to
their peculiar position and academic
practices that, among a host of distinguished
humanists, we possess in
George Buchanan the most illustrious
writer in the Roman tongue, both in
poetry and prose, since the best days
of Rome.</p>

<p class='c009'>The records before us afford some
amusing instances of the anxious zeal
with which any lapse into the vernacular
tongue was prevented, and conversation
among the students was
rendered as uneasy and unpleasant as
possible. In the visitorial regulations
of King’s College, Aberdeen, in 1546,
it is provided that the attendant boys—the
gyps, if we may so call them—shall
be expert in the use of Latin, lest
they should give occasion to the masters
or students to have recourse to
the vernacular speech: “<i><span lang="la">Ne dent occasionem
magistris et Studentibus lingua
vernacula uti.</span></i>” If Aberdeen supplied
a considerable number of waiting-boys
thus accomplished, the stranger wandering
to that far northern region, in
the seventeenth century, might have
been as much astonished as the man
in <cite>Ignoramus</cite>, who tested the state of
education in Paris by finding that
even the dirty boys in the streets
were taught French. It would, after
all, have perhaps been more difficult
to find waiting-boys who could speak
English. The term by which they
are described is a curious indication
of the French habits and traditions
of the northern universities: they are
spoken of as <i><span lang="fr">garciones</span></i>—a word of
obvious origin to any one who has
been in a French hotel.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Glasgow, in a law passed in
1667, it is provided that “all who
are delated by the public censor for
speaking of English shall be fined in
an halfpenny <i><span lang="la">toties quoties</span></i>.” The sum
is not large, but the imposition of the
penalty at that particular juncture
looks rather unreasonable, since the
Senate and the Faculty of Arts had
just abandoned the use of Latin in
their public documents, and had
adopted what, if not strictly English,
was the vernacular tongue—a change
which was doubtless as much to their
own ease as it is to the satisfaction of
the reader, who becomes painfully
alive to the continued and progressive
barbarisation of the academic
Latin.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a great measure, however, it
seems to have been less the object
in view to inculcate Latin than to
discountenance the vernacular language
of the country. In some instances
the language of France is
admitted; and, from the number of
Scotsmen who carved out their fortunes
in that hospitable and affluent
country, this acquisition must have
been one of peculiar value. In a set
of statutes and laws of the Grammar
School of Aberdeen, adopted
in 1553, there is a very singular
liberty of choice—the pupils might
speak in Greek, Hebrew, or even in
Gaelic, rather than in Lowland Scots:
“Loquantur omnes Latinè, Græcè,
Hebraicè, Gallicè, Hybernicè—nunquam
vernaculè, saltem cum his qui
Latinè noscunt.” This is by no means
to be held as an indication of the
familiar acquaintance of the Aberdonian
students with the language of
the Gael; on the contrary, it shows
how entirely this was placed within
the category of foreign tongues. We
know no other instances in which the
tongue of the Highlander is spoken of
in connection with the earlier educational
institutions of the country; but
we think it not improbable that any
encouragement it received was for
much the same reason that Hindostanee
and the African dialects are now
sometimes taught to young divines—that
they may work as missionaries
among the heathen. A few students
from this wild region, to which Christianity
had scarcely penetrated, were
indeed a peculiar feature of the educational
institutions of Aberdeen, and
in a modified shape so remain to this
day, since some wild men from the
hills, spending a brief period at school
or college to acquire a fragment of
education, are yet known by the term
<i><span lang="it">extranni</span></i>, of old applied to them.
There is a prevailing, but utterly false
impression, that Aberdeen is in the
Highlands. It lingers chiefly, in the
present century, with Cockneys beginning
their first northern tour; but
in the seventeenth century it may,
perhaps, have been entertained even
in the metropolis of Scotland. Hence
the educational institutions there,
though at the extremity of a long
tract of agricultural lowland, inhabited
by a Teutonic people, and farther
separated from the actual Celtic line
than Edinburgh itself, are generally
talked of in old documents as those
which are peculiarly available for the
civilisation of the Highlanders. Glasgow
was nearer and more accessible
to the great body of the western
Celts; but in this town the prejudices
against them were greater, and
the alienation, especially in religion,
was more emphatic. It was to Aberdeen
then, generally, that the son of
a predatory chief would be sent, to fit
him in some measure for converse
with the civilised world, such as it
then was; and the fierce owner of a
despotic power over his clansmen
would appear among the sober burgesses
of the northern metropolis
much as an American chief may
among the inhabitants of some distant
city in the Union. Lovat studied
at King’s College, in Aberdeen, and
there acquired a portion of those accomplishments
which made him act
the subtle courtier in Paris or London,
and reserve his sanguinary ruffianism
for Castle Dunie. Not unmindful
of the benefits of the institution,
some of the Celtic princes bestowed
endowments on it. Thus, the
Laird of Macintosh, who begins in
the true regal style, “We, Lachlan
Macintosh of that ilk,” and who calls
himself the Chief and <em>Principall</em> of the
Clan Chattan—probably using the
term which he thought would be the
most likely to make his supremacy
intelligible to university dignitaries—dispenses
to the King’s College two
thousand marks, “for maintaining
hopeful students thereat.” He reserves,
however, a dynastic control
over the endowment, making it conducive
to the clan discipline and the
support of the hierarchy surrounding
the chief. It was a condition that
the beneficiary should be presented
“by the lairds of Macintosh successively
in all time coming; that a
youth of the name of Macintosh or of
Clan Chattan shall be preferred to
those of any other name,” &#38;c.—<cite>Fasti</cite>,
206. This document is titled in the
records, “Macintosh’s Mortification,”
according to a peculiar technical application
of that expression in Scotland,
to the perpetuity of possession
which in England is termed mortmain.
Later in the eighteenth century,
M‘Lean of Coll causes another
mortification to be “applied towards
the maintenance and education of such
young man or boy of the name of
M‘Lean as shall be recommended
by me, or my heirs or successors
on the estate of Coll.” This is
probably the same Highland potentate
who frowned so savagely on
young Colman, when he, seeing an
old gentleman familiarly called Coll
by his contemporaries, addressed him
as Mr Coll. Such a solecism would
never be permitted to pass as an accidental
mistake, since it would be
utterly impossible to convince the
mighty chief of Coll that there existed
in this world a person ignorant
enough to be unacquainted with his
style and title. At a still later date,
a bequest is more gracefully made by
Sir John M‘Pherson: “In testimony
of my gratitude to the University of
Old Aberdeen, I bequeath to ditto, so
as to afford an annual bursary to any
Highland student who may be selected
to receive the said bursary,
two thousand five hundred pounds of
my Carnatic stock.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here there is a wider range of application,
but still the endowment is to a
Highland student. Nor, after all, when
the social state of the Highlanders is
considered, can we wonder that their
gentry should seek to preserve the
wealth which they are constrained to
deposit in the hands of the stranger for
their own people. Occasionally, at the
present day, some wild wiry M‘Lean or
M‘Dougal makes his appearance, by
command of the chief, at the proper
time and place, to claim investment
in the clan bursary. Other of these
endowments are of restricted application,
being exclusively appropriated
to students of a special name, such as
Smith or Thomson, or born in a special
parish, or descended from members
of some corporation. In general,
however, these endowments—some of
them of very ancient date—are open
to free universal competition, and
are in this shape one of the most interesting
and remarkable specimens
of the ancient literary republics, in
which each man fought with his
brains, and held what his brains could
achieve for him. Annually, at the
competition for bursaries in Aberdeen,
there assembles a varied group of intellectual
gladiators—long red-haired
Highlanders, who feel trousers and
shoes an infringement of the liberty
of the subject—square-built Lowland
farmers—flaxen-haired Orcadians,
and pale citizens’ sons, vibrating between
scholarship and the tailor’s
board or the shoemaker’s last. Grim
and silent they sit for a day, rendering
into Latin an English essay, and
drop away one by one, depositing
with the judges the evidence of success
or failure as the case may be.
The thing is very fairly and impartially
managed, and honourable to all
the parties concerned.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is indeed, as we have hinted, a
relic of the old competitive spirit
which distinguished the universities
as literal republics of letters, where
each man fought his own battle, and
gained and wore his own laurels.
Nor was his arena confined to his
own college. The free-masonry we
have already alluded to opened every
honour and emolument to all, and the
Scotsman might suddenly enter the
lists at Paris, Bologna, or Upsala, or
the Spaniard might compete in Glasgow
or Aberdeen. The records before
us contain many forms in which
the ancient spirit has now ceased
to breathe. Already has been mentioned
the competition for the regentship.
The old form of the Impugnment
of Theses, so renowned in literary
histories, has died away as a portion
of the ordinary laureation. The
comprehensive challenges and corresponding
victories attributed to the
Admirable Crichton give this practice
a peculiar interest in the eyes of
Scotsmen; and it has a great place in
the annals of the Reformation, since
one of its main stages was the posting
the twenty-five theses on the door of
the church of Würtemberg by Luther.
But in reading these remarkable events
people are apt to forget the commonness
of the practice; and Crichton has
the aspect of a preposterous intellectual
bully going out of his proper way
to attract notice, instead of doing what
was in its time and circumstances as
ordinary and common sense an act as
running a tilt, joining a crusade, or
burning a witch. Goldsmith, in that
account of the intellectual vagabond
which so evidently describes himself,
has noticed some relics of the practice
as he found it on the Continent.
“In all the universities and convents
there are, upon certain days, philosophical
theses maintained against
every adventitious disputant; for
which, if the champion opposes with
any dexterity, he can claim a gratuity
in money, a dinner, and a bed for one
night. In this manner, then, I fought
my way towards England.” A collection
of German pamphlets, amounting,
it is said, to upwards of a hundred
thousand, and called the Dietrich Collection,
was some years ago purchased
by the Faculty of Advocates, and was
found to consist chiefly of the academic
theses in which the scholars of Germany—illustrious
and obscure—had
been disputing for centuries. In the
same place, by the way, where this
vast collection reposes, may be found
the most complete living illustration
of the old form of impugnment. The
anxious litigant or busy agent entering
the main door of the Parliament
House at 9 o’clock of a morning, may
find, by an <em>affiche</em> to the door-post,
that there is to be a <i><span lang="la">disputatio juridica</span></i>
under the auspices of the <i><span lang="la">inclytus Diaconus
facultatis</span></i>. Since the year 1693
it has been the practice of each intrant
to undergo public impugnment, or, as
the act of Faculty says, “the publict
tryall of candidates, by printing and
publishing theses on the subject assigned
with corollaries, as it is observed
amongst other nations.” A
title of the Pandects is assigned on
each occasion. Thus the Faculty
possesses more than one running commentary
upon that celebrated collection;
and it has always been deemed
remarkable that, considering the number
and varied talent of the authors of
these theses, they should be so uniform
in their Latinity and structure.
A great innovation has lately taken
place in sparing the cost of printing
the theses, and applying the amount
so saved to the Faculty’s magnificent
library.</p>

<p class='c009'>Many of the old university theses are
very interesting as the youthful efforts
of men who have subsequently become
eminent. Those connected with Aberdeen
are apparently the most numerous.
It is very noticeable, indeed,
that in the remote rival institutions
there established, the spirit and practice
of the Continental universities, in
almost every department, had their
most tenacious existence. As in England,
the Church of Rome was succeeded
there, not by Presbyterianism but
Episcopacy, and there were fewer
changes in all old habits and institutions.
The celebrated “Aberdeen
doctors,” who carried on a controversy
with the Covenanters, met their
zealous religionists with something
like the old pedantic formality of the
academic system of disputation. They
resolved the Covenant into a thesis,
and impugned it. Of this remarkable
group of scholars we have the following
notice in Professor Innes’s Preface:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Their names are now little known,
except to the local antiquary; but no
one who has even slightly studied the
history of that disturbed time is unacquainted
with the collective designation
of ‘the Aberdeen Doctors’ bestowed
upon the learned ‘querists’ of the ultra-Presbyterian
Assembly of 1638, and the
most formidable opponents of the Solemn
League and Covenant.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of these learned divines, Dr Robert
Barron had succeeded Bishop Forbes in
his parish of Keith, and from thence was
brought on the first opportunity to be
made Minister of Aberdeen, and afterwards
Professor of Divinity in Marischal
College. He is best judged by the estimation
of his own time, which placed
him foremost in philosophy and theology.
Bishop Sydserf characterises him as ‘<span lang="la">vir
in omni scholastica theologia et omni
literatura versatissimus:</span>’ ‘A person
of incomparable worth and learning,’
says Middleton, ‘he had a clear apprehension
of things, and a rare facultie of
making the hardest things to be easily
understood.’<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c007'><sup>[10]</sup></a> Gordon of Rothiemay says,
‘He was one of those who maintained the
unanswerable dispute (in 1638) against
the Covenante, which drew upon him both
ther envye, hate, and calumneyes; yet so
innocently lived and dyed hee, that such
as then hated him doo now reverence his
memorye, and admire his works.’ Principal
Baillie, of the opposite party, speaks
of him as ‘a meek and learned person,’
and always with great respect: and
Bishop Jeremy Taylor, when writing
in 1659 to a fellow of Trinity College,
Dublin, recommending the choice of
books for ‘the beginning of a theological
library,’ named two treatises of
Barron’s especially, and recommended
generally ‘everything of his.’<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c007'><sup>[11]</sup></a> That
a man so honoured for his learning and
his life should receive the indignities
inflicted on Barron after his death, is
rather to be held as a mark of the general
coarseness of the time, than attributed
to the persecuting spirit of any one sect.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c007'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>“Another of the Aberdeen doctors,
William Leslie, was successively Sub-principal
and Principal of King’s College.
The visitors of 1638 found him worthie
of censure, as defective and negligent in
his office, but recorded their knowledge
that he was ‘ane man of gude literature,
lyff, and conversatioun.’<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c007'><sup>[13]</sup></a> ‘He was a
man,’ says James Gordon, ‘grave, and
austere, and exemplar. The University
was happy in having such a light as he,
who was eminent in all the sciences
above the most of his age.’<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c007'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>“Dr James Sibbald, Minister of St
Nicholas, and a Regent in the University,
is recorded by the same contemporary:
‘It will not be affirmed by his very enemyes,
but that Dr James Sibbald was
ane eloquent and painefull preacher, a
man godly, and grave, and modest, not
tainted with any vice unbeseeming a
minister, to whom nothing could in reason
be objected, if you call not his ante-covenanting
a cryme.’<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c007'><sup>[15]</sup></a> Principal Baillie,
while condemning his Arminian doctrines,
says—‘The man was, there, of great
fame.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dr Alexander Scroggy, minister in
the Cathedral Church, first known to the
world as thought worthy to contribute to
the ‘Funerals’ of his patron and friend,
Bishop Forbes,<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c007'><sup>[16]</sup></a> is described in 1640 by
Gordon as ‘a man sober, grave, and
painefull in his calling;’<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c007'><sup>[17]</sup></a> and by Baillie
as ‘ane old man, not verie corrupt, yet
perverse in the Covenant and Service-book.’
His obstinacy yielded under
the weight of old age and the need of
rest, but he is not the more respected for
the questionable recantation of all his
early opinions.<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c007'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>“Foremost, by common consent, among
that body of divines and scholars, was
John Forbes, the good bishop’s son. He
had studied at King’s College, and, after
completing his education in the approved
manner by a round of foreign universities,
returned to Scotland to take his
doctor’s degree, and to be the first professor
in the chair of theology, founded
and endowed in our University by his
father and the clergy of the diocese. Dr
John Forbes’s theological works have
been appreciated by all critics and students,
and have gone some way to remove
the reproach of want of learning from
the divines of Scotland. His greatest
undertaking, the <cite><span lang="la">Instructiones historico-theologicæ</span></cite>,
which he left unfinished,
Bishop Burnett pronounces to be ‘a work
which, if he had finished it, and had been
suffered to enjoy the privacies of his retirement
and study to give us the second
volume, had been the greatest treasure
of theological learning that perhaps the
world has yet received.<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c007'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>“These were the men whom the bishop
drew into the centre and heart of the
sphere which he had set himself to illuminate;
and in a short space of time, by
their united endeavours, there grew up
around their Cathedral and University a
society more learned and accomplished
than Scotland had hitherto known, which
spread a taste for literature and art beyond
the academic circle, and gave a
tone of refinement to the great commercial
city and its neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It must be confessed cultivation was
not without bias. It would seem that,
in proportion as the Presbyterian and
Puritan party receded from the learning
of some of their first teachers, literature
became here, as afterwards in England,
the peculiar badge of Episcopacy.
With Episcopacy went, hand in hand, the
high assertion of royal authority; and
influenced as it had been by Bishop
Patrick Forbes and his followers, Aberdeen
became, and continued for a century
to be, not only a centre of northern academic
learning, but a little stronghold of
loyalty and Episcopacy—the marked seat
of high Cavalier politics and anti-Puritan
sentiments of religion and church government.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That there was a dash of pedantry
in the learning of that Augustan age of
our University, was the misfortune of the
age, rather than peculiar to Aberdeen.
The literature of Britain and all Europe,
except Italy, was still for the most part
scholastic, and still to a great degree
shrouded in the scholastic dress of a dead
language; and we must not wonder that
the northern University exacted from
her divines and philosophers, even from
her historians and poets, that they should
use the language of the learned. After
all, we owe too much to classical learning
to grudge that it should for a time have
overshadowed and kept down its legitimate
offspring of native literature. ‘We
never ought to forget,’ writes one worthy
to record the life and learning of Andrew
Melville, ‘that the refinement and the
science, secular and sacred, with which
modern Europe is enriched, must be
traced to the revival of ancient literature,
and that the hid treasures could not have
been laid open and rendered available
but for that enthusiasm with which the
languages of Greece and Rome were
cultivated in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries.’<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c007'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>“It is not to be questioned that in the
literature of that age, and in all departments
of it, Aberdeen stood pre-eminent.
Clarendon commemorates the ‘many excellent
scholars and very learned men
under whom the Scotch universities,
and especially Aberdeen, flourished.’<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c007'><sup>[21]</sup></a>
‘Bishop Patrick Forbes,’ says Burnet,
‘took such care of the two colleges in
his diocese, that they became quickly
distinguished from all the rest of Scotland....
They were an honour to
the Church, both by their lives and by
their learning; and with that excellent
temper they seasoned that whole diocese,
both clergy and laity, that it continues
to this very day very much distinguished
from all the rest of Scotland, both for
learning, loyalty, and peaceableness.’<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c007'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>“That this was no unfounded boast,
as regards one department of learning,
has been already shown, in enumerating
the learned divines who drew upon Aberdeen
the general attention soon after the
death of their bishop and master. In
secular learning it was no less distinguished.
No one excelled Robert Gordon
of Straloch in all the accomplishments
that honour the country gentleman.
Without the common desire of fame or
any more sordid motive, he devoted his
life and talents to illustrate the history
and literature of his country. He was
the prime assistant to Scotstarvet in his
two great undertakings, the Atlas and
the collections of Scotch poetry.<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c007'><sup>[23]</sup></a> The
maps of Scotland in the Great Atlas
(many of them drawn by himself, and
the whole ‘revised’ by him at the earnest
entreaty of Charles I.), with the topographical
descriptions that accompany
them, are among the most valuable contributions
ever made by an individual to
the physical history of his country. His
son, James Gordon, parson of Rothiemay,
followed out his father’s great objects
with admirable skill, and in two particulars
he merits our gratitude even more.
He was one of the earliest of our countrymen
to study drawing, and to apply it
to plans and views of places; and, while
he could wield Latin easily, he condescended
to write the history of his time
in excellent Scotch.</p>

<p class='c011'>“While these writers were illustrating
the history of their country in prose, a
crowd of scholars were writing poetry,
or, at least, pouring forth innumerable
copies of elegant Latin verses. While
the two Johnstons were the most distinguished
of those poets of Aberdeen, John
Leech, once Rector of our University,<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c007'><sup>[24]</sup></a>
David Wedderburn, rector of the Grammar
School, and many others, wrote and
published pleasing Latin verse, which
stands the test of criticism. While it
cannot be said that such compositions
produce on the reader the higher effects
of real poetry, they are not without
value, if we view them as tests of the
cultivation of the society among which
they were produced. Arthur Johnston
not only addresses elegiacs to the bishop
and his doctors, throwing a charming
classical air over their abstruser learning,
but puts up a petition to the magistrates
of the city, or celebrates the charms of
Mistress Abernethy, or the embroideries
of the Lady Lauderdale—all in choice
Latin verse, quite as if the persons whom
he addressed appreciated the language of
the poet.<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c007'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>“Intelligent and educated strangers,
both foreigners and the gentry of the
north, were attracted to Aberdeen; and
its colleges became the place of education
for a higher class of students than had
hitherto been accustomed to draw their
philosophy from a native source.<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c007'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>“If it was altogether chance, it was a
very fortunate accident, which placed in
the midst of a society so worthy of commemoration
a painter like George Jamiesone,
the pupil of Rubens, the first, and,
till Raeburn, the only great painter whom
Scotland had produced. Though he was
a native of Aberdeen, it is not likely that
anything but the little court of the bishop
could have induced such an artist to prosecute
his art in a provincial town. An
academic orator in 1630, while boasting
of the crowd of distinguished men, natives
and strangers, either produced by the
University, or brought to Aberdeen by
the bishop, was able to point to their
pictures ornamenting the hall where his
audience were assembled. Knowing by
whom these portraits were painted, we
cannot but regret that so few are preserved.”<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c007'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Keeping, however, to the matter of
academic impugnment, we shall now
turn to an instance of its incidental
occurrence in that University, which,
from its late origin, was least imbued
with the spirit of the Continental
system.</p>

<p class='c009'>The visit of King James to his
ancient kingdom in 1617, afforded the
half-formed collegiate institution in
Edinburgh an opportunity for a rhetorical
display, which ended in substantial
advantages. Tired with business
at Holyrood, and in the enjoyment
of full eating and drinking, and “driving
our” at his quieter palace of Stirling,
he bethought himself of a rhetorical
pastime with the professors of
the new University, wherein he could
not fail to luxuriate in the scholastic
quibbling with which his mind was
so well crammed, and he was pretty
certain of enjoying an ample banquet
of success and applause. Hence, as
Thomas Crawford the annalist of the
institution informs us, “It pleased his
majesty to appoint the maisters of the
college to attend him at Sterling the
29th day of July, where, in the royal
chapel, his majesty, with the flower of
the nobility, and many of the most
learned men of both nations, were
present, a little before five of the
clock, and continued with much chearfulness
above three hours.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The display was calculated to be
rather appalling to any man who had
much diffidence or reserve in his disposition,
and hence Charteris, the principal,
“being naturally averse from
public show, and professor of divinity,”
transferred the duty of leading
the discussion to Professor Adamson.
The form adopted was the good
old method of the impugnment of
theses, so many being appointed to
defend, and so many to impugn; “but
they insisted only upon such purposes
as were conceived would be most
acceptable to the king’s majesty and
the auditory.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The first thesis was better suited
for the legislature than an academic
body, and there must have been some
peculiar reason for bringing it on. It
was, “that sheriffs and other inferior
magistrates should not be hereditary,”
which was oppugned by Professor
Lands “with many pretty arguments.”
The king was so pleased
with the oppugnation, that he turned to
the Marquis of Hamilton, hereditary
sheriff of Clydesdale, and said,
“James, you see your cause lost—and
all that can be said for it clearly
satisfied and answered.” <em>N.—B.</em> It is
just worth noticing that the College
and the Marquis were then at feud.
There was a question about the possession
of the old lodging of the Hamilton
family, then constituting a considerable
portion of the University
edifices. The “gud old nobleman,”
his father, had been easily satisfied,
but the young man was determined to
stand upon his rights, and, though he
could not recover possession, get something
in the shape of rent or damages;
nor would he take the judicious hint
that “so honourable a personage
would never admit into his thoughts
to impoverish the patrimony of the
young University, which had been so
great an ornament, and so fruitful an
instrument of so much good to the
whole nation, but rather accept of
some honourable acknowledgment of
his munificence in bestowing upon the
College an honest residence for the
muses.” But to return to the impugnment.
The next thesis was on local
motion, “pressing many things by
clear testimonies of Aristotle’s text;”
and this passage of literary arms called
out one of James’s sallies of pawky persiflage.
“These men,” he said, “know
Aristotle’s mind as well as himself
did while he lived.” The next thesis
was on the “Original of Fountains;”
and the discussion, much to the purpose,
no doubt, was so interesting that
it was allowed to go on far beyond
the prescribed period, “his majesty
himself sometimes speaking for the
impugner, and sometimes for the defender,
in good Latin, and with much
knowledge of the secrets of philosophy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Talking is, however, at the best, dry
work. His majesty went at last to
supper, and no doubt would have
what is termed “a wet night.” When
up to the proper mark, he sent for the
professors, and delivered himself of
the following brilliant address:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Methinks these gentlemen, by
their very names, have been destined
for the acts which they have had in
hand to-day. Adam was father of
all; and, very fitly, Adamson had the
first part of this act. The defender is
justly called Fairly—his thesis had
some fair lies, and he defended them
very fairly, and with many fair lies
given to the oppugners. And why
should not Mr Lands be the first to
enter the lands? but now I clearly
see that all lands are not barren, for
certainly he hath shown a fertile wit.
Mr Young is very old in Aristotle.
Mr Reed needs not be red with blushing
for his acting to-day. Mr King
disputed very kingly, and of a kingly
purpose, anent the royal supremacy of
reason over anger and all passions.”
And here his majesty was going to
close the encomiums, when some one
nudged his elbow, and hinted that he
had omitted to notice the modest
Charteris; but the royal wit was not
abashed, and his concluding impromptu
was by no means the least
successful of his puns. “Well, his
name agreeth very well to his nature;
for charters contain much matter, yet
say nothing, but put great purposes in
men’s mouths.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Few natures would be churlish
enough to resist a genial glow of satisfaction
on receiving such pearls of
rhetoric scattered among them by a
royal hand, and we may believe that
the professors were greatly gratified.
But, pleased more probably by his own
success, the king gave a more substantial
mark of his satisfaction, and said,
“I am so well satisfied with this
day’s exercise, that I will be godfather
to the College of Edinburgh,
and have it called the College of
King James; for after the founding
of it had been stopped for sundry
years in my minority, so soon as I
came to any knowledge, I zealously
held hand to it, and caused it to be
established; and although I see many
look upon it with an evil eye, yet I
will have them to know that, having
given it this name, I have espoused its
quarrel.” And further on in the
night, he promised, “that as he had
given the College a name, he would
also, in time convenient, give it a
royal godbairn gift for enlarging the
patrimony thereof.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the course of the multifarious
talk of the evening, a curious and
delicate matter was opened up—the
difference between the English pronunciation
of Latin and the Scottish,
which corresponds with that of Europe
in general. An English doctor, who
must have enjoyed exceptional opinions,
or been a master of hypocrisy,
praised the readiness and elegancy of
his majesty’s Latinity; on which he
said, “All the world knows that my
maister, Mr George Buchanan, was
a great maister in that faculty. I follow
his pronunciation both of Latin
and Greek, and am sorry that my
people of England do not the like, for
certainly their pronunciation utterly
spoils the grace of these two learned
languages; but you see all the university
and learned men of Scotland
express the true and native pronunciation
of both.”<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c007'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Dear Ebony.—Had I known that
you would treacherously publish my
private communications, and that
Maga comes to Madrid, I certainly
would have waited until I had quitted
this capital, before imparting to you
my impressions of it, its inhabitants,
and its institutions. I admit that I
have but myself to blame for my ignorance
of the fact that Maga, whose
fame extends to the uttermost parts of
the earth, has her regular readers even
in Madrid. But you, who must be
aware of that fact, are not the less
culpable for risking the valuable life
of your old ally and contributor. You
might have had a little more consideration
for your outpost than to expose
him to the thrust of an Albacete
dagger or Catalan knife, whether dealt
under the fifth rib, or treacherously in
the back. You should have reflected
that my olive-green uniform, with a
golden thistle on the black-facings,
would naturally betray my quality of
Maga’s vedette. Since the 10th of
June, date of the Magazine’s arrival
in Madrid, my existence has not been
worth an hour’s purchase. I have
been obliged to strike my tent, pitched
in the Puerta del Sol, as the best place
for observation, and to picket my
charger in the recesses of the Retiro,
whose cool shades, I confess, are not
altogether to be despised now that the
thermometer ranges from 90 to 100 in
the shade, and that the streets of this
capital resemble nothing so much as
limekilns, thanks to dust from demolitions,
and to the rays of a sun compared
to which the Phœbus of the
British Isles is a very feeble impostor.
You are, of course, aware of the pleasant
peculiarities of the Madrid climate—Siberia
in winter and in the
wind; the Sahara in summer and in
the sun. We are just now in all the
delights of the dogdays; a wet brick
is sunburned red in half an hour;
eggs, placed for ten minutes on the
tiles, open for the exit of lively
chickens; and Madrid, to avoid calcination,
flies to the woods and waves.
As I hope soon to follow its example,
and shall consequently not be here
when your August number arrives,
I will venture to send you another
epistle, notwithstanding that I have
received sundry mysterious warnings
that a repetition of my first offence
would lead to prompt blood-letting.
This time, however, I shall have less
to say of the follies and failings of the
natives, and more of what has occurred
since last I troubled you with
my prose. Then I did but glance at
politics <em>en passant</em>; now, I propose
devoting my whole letter to them.
Just one fortnight ago there occurred
at Madrid an event so important that
I think it best to confine myself to an
account of it, and to reserve lighter
matters for a future communication.
I need hardly say that the event in
question is the military insurrection
of the 28th of June.</p>

<p class='c009'>Things had been in rather a queer
state here for some time past. As
you may possibly, amidst the excitement
of the Eastern question, have
neglected to follow up the minute
intricacies of Spanish politics, I must
step back a pace or two, in order to
put you <em>au fait</em>. Autumn of last
year witnessed the arrival at power
of the present ministry, which speedily
became far more unpopular than,
for some time past, any administration
had been. Headed by an unprincipled
and unscrupulous adventurer, it
recoiled from no illegality or tyranny
that might conduce to its own advantage.
Defeated in the senate by a
large majority, on the memorable
railway question, it suspended the
session, and began to indulge its
hatred of those who assisted in its
rebuff. In January of the present
year, about a month after the closing
of the legislative chambers, some of
the most formidable of its opponents,
on that occasion and on most others,
were ordered into exile. It is customary
and legal in Spain for the
minister to assign a residence to
unemployed officers, whither they are
bound to proceed. In those dispositions,
the convenience of the officers
is usually to a certain extent consulted,
but sometimes, especially for
political reasons, the contrary is the
case, and such assignment of quarters
becomes little less than a sentence of
banishment. A military man may be
authorised to reside in Madrid (the
Spaniard’s paradise), or transported
to the Philippines, which he would
consider purgatory. As most military
men of high rank in this country are
more or less political characters,
either having held office, or hoping
some day to find a place in one of
the ephemeral Spanish governments
(whose existence rarely exceeds a
year, and is sometimes limited to a
day), and constantly manœuvring to
obtain it, they hold it a cruel destiny
that consigns them to a colonial abode,
or to vegetation in a remote town, far
from the capital, that centre of every
kind of intrigue. It may be imagined,
therefore, with what extreme disgust
some of the military chiefs of the
Moderado opposition suddenly found
themselves ordered to places where
they would be at full liberty to study
strategy, or play the Cincinnatus in
their cabbage gardens, but where they
would be forgotten by the world, and
powerless to annoy the ministers or
to forward their own ambitious views.
Generals Leopold O’Donnell, Manuel
Concha, José Concha, and Infante
(a deserter from the Progresista or
liberal party), were the men whose
influence and intrigues the Sartorius
ministry thus attempted to annul.
The two former were ordered to the
Canary Islands, the two latter to the
Balearics. Manuel Concha and Infante
obeyed orders and departed for
their destinations; José Concha, by
far the cleverer of the brothers, went
into France; O’Donnell disappeared,
and it was not until some time afterwards
that it became known where
he was concealed. From the time of
these banishments (the latter part of
January) may be dated the commencement
of the conspiracy which
has just broken out in the shape of a
military insurrection.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the 20th of February, the regiment
of Cordova, quartered at Saragossa,
rose in revolt, headed by its
colonel, Brigadier Hore, an officer of
merit, who had served in the royal
guards during the civil war. Nearly
the whole of the garrison, and several
officers of high rank, were pledged to
support the movement; but some of
the latter played the traitor, others
hesitated at the very moment when
promptness and decision were most
necessary; José Concha, who was
then concealed in Spain, and expected
to start up at Saragossa to head the
revolt, did not appear, but soon afterwards
presented himself to the authorities
of Bordeaux. In short, the
whole thing failed. The Cordova regiment
was broken up; changes were
made in one or two garrisons; a number
of arrests, especially of military
men and newspaper editors, were
made in Madrid; promotions and decorations
were lavished upon certain
officers, amongst whom were some
who had betrayed to death the friends
and confederates they had promised
to support; the last of the insurgents
were driven across the frontier; the
government emerged from the brief
struggle with renewed strength, and
became daily more unconstitutional,
arbitrary, and tyrannical.</p>

<p class='c009'>Within a short time after the incidents
I have thus briefly sketched, it
was generally reported that the place
where the Moderado opposition (noway
discouraged by the disaster in
Arragon) intended to make their next
attempt, was Madrid itself. The conduct
of the government in the mean
time had certainly been such as to
irritate its enemies, and rouse public
indignation. No one was safe from
the despotic system introduced. Illegal
arrests were of frequent occurrence,
made without a shadow of a
pretext, and whose victims, conscious
of no crime, were left to languish
in prison, transported to the
colonies, or escorted out of Spain.
The opposition journals were daily
seized, not only for the articles they
published, but for the mere news they
gave, as there were many things
which ministers did not choose to have
communicated to the nation except in
the falsified version given by their own
journals. The <cite><span lang="es">Clamor Publico</span></cite>, ably
conducted by a staunch and well-known
liberal, Don Fernando Corradi;
the <cite><span lang="es">Nacion</span></cite>, also a Progresista paper,
whose editor, Rua Figueroa, still contrived
to write in it from the concealment
to which an order for his arrest
had compelled him; the <cite><span lang="es">Diario Español</span></cite>
and the <cite><span lang="es">Epoca</span></cite>, representing the
Moderado opposition, were the chief
objects of ministerial oppression and
vindictiveness, and day after day their
columns were headed with the announcement,
that their first edition
had been seized by order of the censor.
In spite of this persecution, they
steadily persevered, opposing the government
as well as they might, but
prevented from exposing, otherwise
than by inference and in a most guarded
manner, the scandalous corruption
and jobbing of the ministers and the
court. Discontent was general, and
daily increased. It was asked when
the Cortes were to assemble, for only
in their discussions did there seem a
chance of such expression of public
opinion as might alarm and check the
men in power. These, however, had
no intention of calling together the
legislative chambers. They continued
to make laws by decree, and to
sanction, for the benefit of their friends
and adherents, railways and other
national works, for which the approval
of the Cortes was to be asked at some
future day. But that day has not yet
come, nor will it come, so long as the
present ministry is in office and the
Queen-mother supports them, for she
dreads, as much as they do, the exposure
of the countless iniquitous speculations
at the country’s expense, in
which she and her husband have been
concerned, with the connivance and
aid of the government, who thus repaid
her for the countenance that often
stood them in good stead against the
intrigues of the camarilla headed by
the Queen’s favourite. Then there
were frequent rumours of an approaching
<em>coup d’état</em>, on the plan of that of
December 1851 in France, or of that,
nearly resembling it, which the bravo-Murillo
ministry had actually published,
but had been unable to carry
out. All this time (ever since the
outbreak at Saragossa) the whole
country was under martial law; no
<em>coup d’état</em> could confer upon the government
more arbitrary powers than
those it already exercised—it could
but legalise illegality. The case was
vastly different in France and in Spain.
In France, after a period of anarchy,
succeeded by a conflict of political
factions which rendered all government
impossible, a man long depreciated,
but now generally admitted to
be of commanding talent, and, we are
justified in believing, of far more
patriotic mind than he ever had credit
for, cut the knot of the difficulty, at
the cost, certainly, of constitutional
forms, but, as many now think, for
the real benefit of the nation. In
Spain, the situation of affairs was
quite otherwise. Where was here the
vigorous intellect whose judgment, and
firmness and foresight were to guide,
without assistance and through many
perils, the ship of the state. Was it
that of the unfortunate, uneducated
Queen, who detests business, and passes
her life sunk in sloth and sensuality?
Was it to be the upstart unscrupulous
minister who, by sheer audacity (the
most valuable quality for a Spanish
politician who seeks but his own aggrandisement),
had first crawled and
afterwards pushed his way to the head
of the royal council-board? Or would
the arch-intriguer, Maria Christina,
sketch the course her daughter should
adopt when converted into an absolute
sovereign? No, for her time was too
much taken up in adding, at the expense
of Spain, to her already incalculable
wealth, and in planning marriages
for her numerous daughters.
In short, to carry into the higher
sphere of politics the general and servile
imitation of France now observable
in Spain, was an idea repugnant to the
Spanish nation, and which increased,
if possible, the universal discontent
that already prevailed—excited by the
closing of the chambers, the violence
used towards the independent press
(which it was evidently intended to
crush), the notorious corruption of the
administration; the unsatisfactory
state of the finances, tending inevitably
to some extraordinary exactions from
the already over-taxed people; and
last, but not least, by the scandalous
concessions daily made to the friends
and adherents of the ministry, and to
those influential persons, the Rianzares,
Señor Arana, Mr Salamanca,
and others, whose enmity the Sartorius
cabinet dared not encounter, and
whose support they were compelled to
purchase.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was understood that a military
insurrection was contemplated, with
O’Donnell at its head. The government
affected to make light of the
affair, but in reality they were not
without uneasiness, for they could not
but feel—although they daily had it
proclaimed by the hireling <cite><span lang="es">Heraldo</span></cite>
that they were the saviours of the
nation, and the most popular and
prosperous of ministries—that they
were execrated, and that all classes
would rejoice in their downfall. It
is difficult to convey to Englishmen—except
to those who may be personally
acquainted with this singular
country and people—a clear idea of
the state of political affairs in Madrid
during the second quarter of the present
year. I must content myself
with supplying a few detached facts
and details, from which you may,
perhaps, form a notion of the whole.
For three months conspiracy may be
said to have walked the streets of
Madrid openly and in broad daylight.
Almost every one knew that something
was plotting, and a considerable
number of persons could have told the
names of the chief conspirators, and
given some sort of general outline of
their plans. O’Donnell, disobeying
the orders of the Queen’s government,
remained hidden in Madrid,
seeing numerous friends, but undiscoverable
by the police. He had frequent
meetings with his fellow-conspirators;
his wife often saw him;
for some time, during which he was
seriously ill, he was daily visited by
one of the first physicians in Madrid;
still the government, although most
anxious to apprehend him, failed in
every attempt to discover his hiding-place,
which was known to many. It
is rare that the secrets of a conspiracy,
when they have been confided
to so large a number of persons, have
been kept so well and for so long a time
as in the present case; but this caution
and discretion are easily explicable
by the universal hatred felt for
the present government and by the
strong desire for its fall. The superior
police authorities were bitterly
blamed by the minister; large sums
were placed at their disposal, numerous
agents had assigned to them the
sole duty of seeking O’Donnell. All
was in vain. The government paid
these agents well, but O’Donnell, as
it afterwards appeared, paid them
better. A portion, at least, of the
men employed to detect him, watched
over his safety. The government,
ashamed of its impotence to capture,
spread reports that he they sought
had left Madrid; and, afterwards,
that they knew where he was, but
preferred leaving him there and
watching his movements to seizing
him and sending him out of the country,
to prepare, on a foreign soil,
revolutionary movements in the provinces
of Spain. These ridiculous
pretences imposed upon very few.
Could the government have apprehended
O’Donnell, they might not
have dared to shoot him, and might
have hesitated permanently to imprison
him; but they would not have
scrupled to ship him to the Philippines,
where he would have done
little mischief. The truth was, that
they employed every means to discover
his hiding-place, and every
means proved ineffectual. O’Donnell,
I am informed, was concealed in a
house that communicated with the
one next to it, which had back and
front entrances. His friends and the
friendly police kept strict watch. Of
a night, when he sometimes went out
to walk, his safety was cared for by
the very men whom the authorities
had commissioned to look for him,
and who went away with him when
he left Madrid to assume the command
of the insurgents. A gentleman
who, during a certain period,
was in the habit of frequently seeing
him, was one morning on his way to
his place of concealment, and had
entered the street in which it was
situated, when a police agent, making
him a sign, slipped a scrap of paper
into his hand. On it were the words
“Beware, you are watched.” Taking
the hint, the person warned
passed the house to which he was
going, and entered another, in the
same street, where he had friends.
From the window he observed a
policeman, who had been loitering
about as if in the ordinary discharge
of his duty, hastily depart. When
he had made sure that the coast was
clear, he left the house, entered that in
which O’Donnell was, saw him, passed
into the next house, and departed by
the back door. There was soon a
cordon of police agents round the
house into which he first had gone,
but their vigilance was fruitless. I
had this anecdote from one of the
most intimate friends of the person
who visited O’Donnell, and who was
named to me at the same time.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the period of suspense that
preceded the insurrection, attempts
were made to bring about a union between
the Liberal party and the Moderado
opposition. The former, although
divided into sections which differ on
certain points, is unanimous in its
desire to see Spain governed constitutionally.
Overtures were made to
some of its chiefs. It was proposed
that it should co-operate in the overthrow
of the set of men who had
detached themselves from all parties,
and were marching on the high road
to absolutism. These men, known
as the Polacos or Poles—a word
which seems to have had its origin
in an electioneering joke—were odious
alike to Progresistas and Moderados.
But there were great difficulties in the
way of a sincere and cordial junction
between the two principal parties into
which Spaniards are divided. The
Moderados would gladly have availed
themselves of the aid of the Liberals to
upset their common enemy; but they
would give them no guarantees that
they should be, in any way, gainers by
the revolution. The Liberals, on the
other hand, mistrusted the Moderados,
and would not assist men whose aims
they believed to be purely personal.
When the Moderados asked what guarantees
they required, they were quickly
ready with an answer. “Arm the
national guard of Madrid,” they said;
or, “March your troops, as soon as
you have induced them to revolt, at
once into Arragon, with one of our
most influential and determined
chiefs.” The Moderados could not
be induced to listen to such terms.
They found themselves exactly in
the position in which the Progresistas
were in 1843.  Divided amongst
themselves, the probabilities were
that the insurrection they proposed
would turn to the advantage of the
Liberals; and the risk of this was
doubled if they accepted even the
most favourable of the conditions offered
to them. They knew that the
feeling of a large majority of the nation
was in favour of the Progresistas;
that Espartero, although for seven
years he had led the life of a country
gentleman at Logroño, and had
steadily resisted all temptations to
mingle again in political affairs, was
in reality the most popular man in
Spain, and that he was idolised by
the people of Madrid. Some amongst
them (O’Donnell himself, it has been
said), whose views were more patriotic
and less selfish than those of the
majority, were not unwilling to blend
with the Progresistas, to whom a few,
including Rios Rosas, a distinguished
lawyer and senator, frankly proclaimed
their adherence, declaring that
the parties which for so many years
had divided Spain were virtually
defunct, and that there were but two
parties in the country,—the national
one, which desired the welfare of
Spain, and to see it governed according
to the constitution, and the retrograde
or absolutist, which trampled
on the rights of the people. But
although a few men were found ready
to waive personal considerations and
to forget old animosities, the great
majority of the Moderados were less
disinterested, and the decision finally
come to was to do without the aid of
the Liberals, and to accomplish an
insurrection which, although its success
was likely to be of some advantage
to the country, at least for a
time, had for its object a change of
men rather than of measures.</p>

<p class='c009'>One of the most important persons
concerned in the conspiracy was the
Director of Cavalry, Major-General
Domingo Dulce, reputed one of
the best and bravest officers in the
Spanish army, and who had won his
high rank and many honours, not by
political intrigue, as is so frequently
the case in this country, but at the
point of his good sword. He passed
for a Progresista, and most of his
friends were of that party; but in fact
he had never mixed much in politics,
and, as a military man, had served
under governments of various principles.
It is evident, however, that
whilst confining himself to the duties
of his profession—which is rarely the
case with Spanish general officers—he
cherished in his heart the love of
liberty, and a strong detestation of
the tyranny under which Spain has
for some time groaned. An intimate
friend of his, a well-known and distinguished
Liberal, was the immediate
means of his joining the conspiracy.
It was an immense acquisition to the
cause he agreed to assist. Chief of
the whole of the Spanish cavalry, respected
and beloved by the men and
officers under his command, he could
bring a large force to the insurgent
banner, and his own presence beneath
it was of itself of great value, for he
is a daring and decided officer. He
it was who, by his obstinate resistance
in the palace, at the head of a handful
of halberdiers, defeated the designs of
the conspirators in the year 1841.
Dulce is a slightly-made, active, wiry
man, rather below the middle height,
of bilious temperament, and taciturn
mood, extremely reserved, even with
his friends, not calculated to cut a
great figure in the council, but a man
of action, precious in the field. The
other principal conspirators were
General Messina, a man of education
and talent, who had been under-secretary
of the war department,
and is an intimate friend of Narvaez;
Ros de Olano, a general officer of
some repute; and Brigadier Echague,
colonel of the Principe regiment, a
Basque officer who served with high
distinction throughout the whole of
the civil War.</p>

<p class='c009'>Several false starts were made before
the insurrection really broke out.
On the 13th of June, especially, it
had been fixed to take place. The
garrison of Madrid had been ordered
to parade before daybreak for a military
promenade and review outside
the town. Such parades had been
unusually frequent for a short time
past; and it was thought the government
ordered them, owing to information
it received, not sufficiently definite
to compromise the conspirators
personally, but which yet enabled it
to defeat their designs. On that
morning, however, all was ready.
The Principe regiment, instead of
marching directly to the parade
ground, lingered, and finally halted
at a place where it could easily join
the cavalry. O’Donnell left the town,
disguised, and stationed himself in a
house whence he could observe all
that passed. Persons were placed in
the vicinity to watch over his safety.
The proclamations that had been prepared
were got ready for distribution.
Late on the eve of the intended outbreak,
about four or five hours before
it was to occur, its approach was
known to several persons who, without
being implicated in the plot,
sincerely wished it success. There
seemed no doubt of the event. But,
at the very moment, a portion of the
artillery of the garrison, which had
pledged itself to take part in the
movement, failed to make its appearance
at the place of rendezvous.
General Dulce considered their absence
so important that he abandoned,
for that day, his intention of marching
off his cavalry, and declaring against
the government. The combat of the
30th of June, in the fields of Vicálvaro,
showed that he did not overrate
the importance of including all
arms in the composition of the insurrectionary
force. At the time, however,
a storm of censure burst over
his head. He was taxed with treachery,
with a deficiency in moral
courage; his best friends looked mistrustfully
and coldly upon him; more
than one general officer, presuming
on seniority of rank and age, took
him severely to task. General O’Donnell
was not backward in reproaching
him. “Never was a white man”
(these were the very words of the ex-governor
of Cuba) “sold as you have
sold me.” Dulce, although deeply
sensitive to all this blame, took it
meekly, acknowledged that appearances
were against him, but declared
that he had acted for the best, and
steadily affirmed that his future conduct
would prove his fidelity to the
cause he had espoused. Not all believed
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some days passed over, and there
was no word of an insurrection. The
conspirators were discouraged. Rumour
spoke of dissensions among
them. It was thought that nothing
would occur. It was known to many
that Dulce was of the conspiracy, and
that, by his fault or will, a good
opportunity had been lost; and they
said that if he were not playing a
double game, the government would
certainly have heard of his complicity
with O’Donnell, and would at least
have removed him from his command.
It was fact that, for some time past,
anonymous letters had been received
by the ministers, warning them that
he was plotting against them. But
they disbelieved this information, and
some of the letters were even shown
to Dulce. The Duke of Rianzares,
calling one day on a minister, found
Dulce there. “What is this that I
hear, general?” said Queen Christina’s
husband; “is it true that you intend
to shoot us all?” The question was
awkward, but easily parried. A few
days before the insurrection occurred,
Dulce went over to Alcala, five leagues
from Madrid, under pretence of inspecting
the recruits stationed there.
Seven squadrons of cavalry were in
that town. Doubtless his object was
to see if he could still reckon upon
their following him whithersoever he
chose to lead. I met him in the street
after his return; I think it was on the
26th of June. He looked anxious and
careworn. His position was certainly
critical, and it is not presuming too
much to suppose that a severe struggle
was going on within him between a
long habit of military discipline and
duty, and what we must in justice
believe to have been, in his opinion,
a paramount duty to his oppressed
country. For he was at the top of
the tree. His position was splendid;
his emoluments were large; he had
but to persevere in his adherence to
the government of the day to attain
to the very highest rank in his profession—although
that did not afford
a more desirable place than the one
he already occupied. Under these
circumstances, even his enemies must
admit—however guilty they may deem
him—that he was not actuated by the
selfish desire of personal advantage or
aggrandisement.</p>

<p class='c009'>Madrid, incredulous of an insurrection,
was taken completely by surprise
by the news that greeted its uprising
on the morning of the 28th
June. Some hours previously, it was
informed, the director-general of cavalry,
after mustering for review, in a
field just outside the walls, the eleven
squadrons that formed part of the garrison
of the capital, had been joined by a
battalion of the regiment of Principe, by
a few companies from other regiments,
and by General O’Donnell himself, and
had marched to Alcala to incorporate
in his insurrectionary force the troops
there stationed. Other generals, it
was stated, were with him, but for
many hours—indeed for the whole of
that day—truth was hard to be got
at, and Rumour had it all her own
way. The aspect of Madrid was
curious. The Queen and Court had left
two days previously for the Escurial;
all but two of the ministers were absent;
those two were paralysed by the
sudden event, and seemingly helpless.
No measures were taken, no troops
brought out; for a time it might have
been thought that, as was reported,
all but some fifteen hundred of these
had left with the insurgent generals;
for several hours the town was at the
mercy of the people, and had they
then risen it would probably have
been their own, for many of the troops
remaining in Madrid were disaffected
and would have joined them. There
was great excitement; the general
expression was one of joy at the prospect
of getting rid of a ministry than
which none could be more odious;
the Puerta del Sol and the principal
streets were full of groups eagerly discussing
the events of the hour; friends
met each other with joyous countenances,
and shook hands as if in congratulation—Liberals
and Moderados
alike well pleased at the event that
threatened to prove fatal to the common
enemy. I need not repeat the
countless reports current on that day.
The most important fact that became
known was that the cavalry at Alcala
had joined the insurgents, and that
two thousand horsemen, some of the
best dragoons in the Spanish army,
were in hostile attitude close to Madrid,
accompanied by a small but most
efficient body of infantry. Towards
evening the authorities began to
awake from their lethargy of alarm.
Ignorant of the fact that a line of
telegraphic wires had been concluded
on the previous day between Madrid
and the Escurial, the insurgents had
neglected to cut off this means of rapid
communication; news of the insurrection
had been transmitted to the
Queen, and her return to the capital
was announced. The streets were
quickly filled with troops, illuminations
were ordered (there was no
hope of their being volunteered), and at
about ten o’clock her Majesty made her
entrance, passing completely through
the town, having previously been to
perform her devotions in the church
of Atocha, whose presiding virgin is
the special patroness of the royal
family of Spain—the gracious protectress
for whom princes embroider petticoats,
and whose shrine queens enrich
with jewels, whose cost would
found an hospital or comfort many
poor. A young Queen, entering her
capital in haste and anxiety, a few
hours after a revolt against her authority,
ought, one might suppose, to
command, by her mere presence, some
demonstration of loyalty and affection
from her subjects. But the present
Queen of Spain has so completely
weaned from her the affections of her
people, has so well earned their contempt,
and even their hatred, that
neither on that night nor on any
other occasion that I have witnessed
was a voice uplifted or a <em>viva</em> heard.
A body of gendarmes, drawn up opposite
to the ministry of the interior,
cheered as she passed, and possibly
the same may have been the case on
the part of civil and military functionaries
at other points of the line of her
progress, but the attitude of the
people and soldiers was one of perfect
indifference. The same was the case
on the following day, when she reviewed
the garrison in the Prado,
and conferred decorations and promotion
on sergeants and privates who
had distinguished themselves by their
fidelity in refusing to be led away by
the insurgents. Surrounded by a numerous
staff of officers, and having
the troops formed in such wise that as
many as possible of them might hear
her, she addressed to them a short
speech, was profuse of smiles, and
held up to them her infant daughter
as if confiding it to their defence. Now
was the time, if ever, for the old
Castilian loyalty to burst forth in acclamation.
But its spirit is dead,
crushed by royal misconduct and misrule.
Not a cheer was uttered,
either by officer or soldier. The ominous
silence was remarked by all present.
It was equally profound as the
Queen returned to her palace through
the most populous streets of her
capital, crowded on the warm summer
night. It is said and believed here
that, on reaching the palace, she was
so affected and disheartened by the
chilling reception she had on all sides
met, that she burst into a passion of
tears. Pity it is for the poor woman,
who is not without some natural good
qualities, but whom evil influences and
a neglected education have brought
to sorrow and contempt.</p>

<p class='c009'>I cannot pretend to relate all the
incidents of the last fortnight, which
has been crowded with them to an
extent that baffles memory. The
most important you will find in this
letter—many of the minor ones have
doubtless escaped me. I must devote
a few more lines to the first day. An
unsigned proclamation was circulated,
of a tenor by no means unacceptable
to the Liberals, whose chiefs consulted
as to the propriety of rising in arms,
or at least of making some demonstration
of hostility to the government.
Another proclamation, of greater
length, signed by three generals,
O’Donnell, Dulce, and Messina, disappointed
them, for it contained not
a word that guaranteed benefit to the
nation, and spoke merely of the
knavery of the ministers and of the
necessity of getting rid of them.
Moreover, a request was sent in by the
insurgents that Madrid would remain
quiet, and leave them to settle matters
militarily. Between deliberation and
delays the day passed away, and towards
night the altered attitude of
the authorities, who had received
telegraphic orders from Mr Sartorius
to act with the utmost vigour, the
large bodies of troops in the streets
convincing those who had previously
doubted that there was still a sufficient
force in the town to repress any
popular attempt, caused half-formed
plans to fall to the ground, and even
the most ardent and bellicose resolved
to wait the events of the morrow before
shouldering musket and throwing
up barricades.</p>

<p class='c009'>The morrow was the festival of St
Peter, a great holiday, kept quiet as
a Sunday, with much mass and bull-fights.
I presume the churches were
attended, but the bull-fights did not
take place. Some arrests were made,
but not many, for some of the persons
sought after had concealed themselves.
Madrid was still excited, but quite
tranquil. On that and the following
day every sort of rumour was current.
The insurgents were near the town,
and there were frequent reports that
they were coming to attack it. Circulation
was prohibited in the lower
part of the street of Alcala, leading to
the gate near to which the enemy
were supposed to be. The residence
of the Captain-general and the officers
of the staff is in the lower part of
that street, and the constant passage
to and fro of orderlies and aides-de-camp
interested the people: so that
on the line of demarcation, beyond
which there was no passage, there
was a throng from morning till night,
watching—they knew not exactly for
what. From time to time there was
a rush and panic—when the mob encroached
on the limit, and the military
were ordered to make them recede.
The Café Suizo, at the summit of
the street—which rises and again sinks
over a small eminence—was a great
point of rendezvous, and was crowded
with eager politicians. Towards evening,
on the 30th, the garrison (almost
the whole) being out of the town, it
became known that a fight was imminent,
or already begun. This was
in the neighbourhood; but as none
were allowed to pass, or even to approach
the gates, news were scanty,
and little to be relied upon. Cannon
and musketry were heard, and wounded
men were seen straggling in. The
fever of expectation was at its height.
Public opinion was decidedly in favour
of the insurgents. They would beat
the government troops, it was said,
and enter the town pell-mell with
them. All the male population of
Madrid was in the streets, a few
troops were stationed here and there;
there was no disorder, but it was easy
to see that a trifle would produce it.
I was in the Café Suizo, which was
crowded in every part, a short time
after nightfall, when one of the
alarms I have referred to was given.
There was a violent rush in the street
outside, cries and shouts; those without
crowded into the café, most of
those within made for the open doors.
The effect was really startling; it was
exactly that produced by a charge of
troops upon a mob; and I saw more
than one cheek blanch amongst the
consumers of ices and lemonade (the
evening was extremely hot) who
filled the café. But it was a groundless
alarm, produced, as before, merely
by the troops compelling the crowd to
recede. Armed police circulated in
the throng, dispersing groups, and
urging them to go home. Soon the
streets were comparatively clear, but
the clubs and coffee-houses were filled
until past midnight with persons discussing
what had occurred, and giving
fifty different versions. There
had been a fight, it was certain, at
about a league from Madrid, but who
had won and who had lost was a matter
of doubt until the next day.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <cite>Madrid Gazette</cite>, the order of
the day, published by General O’Donnell,
and conversation with officers
present in the short but sharp action,
enable me to give you a sketch, which
you may rely upon as correct, of its
principal incidents. The garrison of
Madrid, consisting of about eight battalions
of infantry, four batteries of
artillery, and some three hundred cavalry,
took position on a ridge of
ground at about a league from Madrid.
The enemy, strong in cavalry, but
weak in infantry, sought to draw them
farther from the town, and into a
more favourable position for horse to
act against them. As the result
proved, the wisest plan would have
been to persevere in these tactics, and,
if the garrison refused to advance
further, to let the day pass without an
action. But General O’Donnell had
assurances that a large portion of the
troops opposed to him only waited an
opportunity to pass over to his banner.
A part of the artillery, especially,
was pledged to do so. After
some preliminary skirmishing, he ordered
a charge, which was made in
gallant style by two squadrons of the
Principe regiment. In spite of a severe
fire of shot and shell, reserved,
until they were within a very short
distance of the battery they attacked,
they got amongst the guns, and sabred
many of the artillerymen, but were prevented
from carrying off the pieces,
and compelled to retire, by the heavy
fire of the squares of infantry formed
in rear of the artillery. Having thus
ascertained, beyond a doubt, that
there was no chance of the artillery
coming over to them, or allowing
themselves to be taken, the insurgents
would have perhaps acted wisely in
making no farther attempts upon the
hostile line, or, if they were resolved
upon a contrary course, in assailing
the flanks, instead of again charging
up to the mouths of the cannon. But
it appears from O’Donnell’s own bulletin
that the troops were not well in
hand, and that, enraged at finding
themselves fired upon by those from
whom they expected a very different
reception, they made several charges
under the direction of their regimental
chiefs, but without the sanction of
their generals. I can hardly give a
better account of the latter part of the
combat than is contained in two short
paragraphs of the insurgent general’s
order of the day, which has been
copied in the government papers, and
admitted by these to be a fair and
true statement of what occurred. The
bulletin is before me, and I translate
the passages in question:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The retreat of the two squadrons of the
Principe cavalry (those which had charged
the battery) was opportunely taken advantage
of by the hostile squadrons of the
Villaviciosa lancers, and of the <i><span lang="es">Guardia
Civil</span></i>, who charged after them. This cavalry,
however, was driven back, when
in full career, by the 3d and 4th squadrons
of the Principe, who routed them,
cutting down a great part of them, and
receiving into their ranks a large number
of the soldiers of Villaviciosa, with their
standard, and four officers, who reversed
their lances, proclaiming themselves
friends. In a second charge made by
these same squadrons, the standard-bearer
of Villaviciosa, and some soldiers of the
same corps, who had joined us only because
they considered themselves prisoners,
went over again to the enemy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The bloody effect of the fire of the
artillery, who, well assured that they would
not be encountered by the same arm (of
which we had none), had deliberately
studied their range, and taken the breasts
of our soldiers for their mark, caused the
action to become hot, and the regiment of
Farnesio again charged upon the guns,
with great valour and determination. At
the very mouth of the cannon its colonel
was wounded and taken prisoner, and several
officers and soldiers were struck
down, our cries of <i><span lang="es">Viva la Reina y la
Constitucion</span></i> being drowned in the roar of
the enemy’s pieces. Repeated charges
of the same regiment, and of those of Bourbon,
Santiago, and the School of Cavalry,
must have convinced our opponents in the
action of Vicálvaro, that the feelings
which prompted those cries are to be
extinguished in the hearts of our brave
soldiers by death alone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The upshot of the action was this:
The insurgents accepted battle when
there was little to be gained by them
in so doing, unless, indeed, the contest
had been conducted very differently,
and a more judicious plan had
been adopted than that of charging
headlong up to the muzzles of artillery
supported by squares of infantry.
But this mistake had its origin, as I
have already observed, in the expectation
that the artillery would not fire.
The insurgents were repulsed, not,
however, without inflicting considerable
loss upon their enemies. The
garrison returned into Madrid in some
haste and confusion, and near the
gate a singular incident occurred. It
was dark, and some lancers appeared
on their flank—insurgents, according
to some accounts—a part of their own
cavalry, as it is reported by others.
The exact truth will probably never
be known. But a panic seized the
infantry; some of the battalions were
composed in great part of recruits;
young soldiers, retiring hastily and
in the dark after their first fight, are
easily alarmed; the confusion that ensued
was as great as that of a rout;
the men fired at random killing and
wounding their own friends, and a
great number, especially of the battalion
of engineers, were thus injured.
The government papers passed this
unlucky mistake almost <i><span lang="la">sub silentio</span></i>;
but the fact is certain, the troops returned
into the town in disorder, and
it was not until the next day that all
the wounded were brought in.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some prisoners had been taken
from the insurgents, including three
or four wounded officers, the chief of
whom, Colonel Garrigó, was captured
amongst the guns, where his horse
fell, killed by grape-shot. The gallant
manner in which Garrigó had led
his men again and again to the charge,
encountering each time a storm of
bullets, had excited a strong interest
in his fate, and measures were taken
to move the queen’s clemency on his
behalf. Before the result of these
were known, and when it was thought
probable that at any hour he might
be judged, condemned, and shot, I
went to the ward of the military hospital
where he lay under arrest, to see
another officer of cavalry who had
been wounded when with the insurgents.
This officer had gone out of
Madrid to see some friends who were
with O’Donnell; he was in plain
clothes and without arms, but, venturing
too far forward during the
action, he got struck from his horse,
and received, as he lay on the ground,
a lance-thrust in the neck, of which,
however, he complained less than of
blows received from the lance-poles,
when the men struck at him as they
rode rapidly past. He had afterwards
been taken prisoner by an officer, and
brought into Madrid. In the next
bed to him was Garrigó, a swarthy,
soldierly-looking man of about fifty-five;
he had been hit in the leg, but
not severely, by a grape-shot, and
was sitting up in bed, fanning away
the flies which entered in unpleasant
numbers through the open windows.
He looked gloomy, but firm. There
were some other wounded officers in
the ward, one of whom subsequently
died after undergoing amputation of
a leg, and a number of soldiers in an
adjoining one. Amongst the insurgents,
I heard there were as many
killed as wounded; and many horses
dead, the artillery having pointed
their guns low. Grape and round
shot, at fifty paces, the distance to
which the cavalry were allowed to
come before the gunners got the word,
were quite as likely, perhaps, to kill
as only to wound. An officer received
two grape-shot in his face—one at
each angle of the nostrils; another,
Captain Letamendi, the English son
of a Spanish father, who served during
the civil war in the British Legion,
was met by a round shot, which
carried away the greater part of his
head. But you will find nothing attractive
in such details.</p>

<p class='c009'>The combat of Vicálvaro, insignificant
in its material results, had little
effect upon the <em>morale</em> of either party.
The government troops were assured
by the gazette that they had achieved
a glorious victory, of which they themselves
were not very sure, especially
when they saw the numerous carts of
wounded that came into the town, and
remembered their own disorderly return
from the field and final panic.
The insurgents, conscious that they
had fought gallantly, and lost no
ground, although they had failed in
their chief object, which was to capture
the artillery, were well satisfied
with themselves, and in no way disheartened
by the event. It was clear
that the insurgent generals must not
reckon on the support of the garrison
of Madrid, and they consequently
changed their plans, retiring to Aranjuez,
a pleasant spot, eight leagues
from Madrid, with abundant shade,
water, and forage, where for two or
three days they gave their men and
horses rest, organised their staff and
commissariat, and took other measures
necessary for the welfare of the division.
There they received several
reinforcements, both of infantry and
cavalry, and were joined by a number
of civilians from Madrid, many
of them belonging to the better
classes. These received caps, muskets,
and belts, and were formed
into a battalion called the <i><span lang="es">Cazadores
di Madrid</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile, the capital anxiously
awaited news from the provinces,
where insurrections were expected to
occur. Madrid itself continued perfectly
tranquil, although occasional
rumours of an intended popular rising
alarmed the government. The excitement
of the first three days subsided
into a strong interest. There
was great eagerness for news from the
insurgents, and much difficulty in
learning anything authentic, especially
when once they had left Aranjuez. Save
the government and its hangers-on and
personal adherents, all Madrid was
for the insurrection, and heartily
wished it well. The recent compulsory
advance of half a year’s taxes,
extorted from the people by a notoriously
corrupt and grasping government,
had greatly incensed the Madrileños,
who did not scruple openly to
express their good wishes for Generals
O’Donnell and Dulce, the most
prominent personages of the day and
of the movement. Although the insurrection
deprived Madrid of two
things which it can ill do without,
bull-fights and strawberries, not a
murmur was heard on this account.
Aranjuez is the strawberry garden of
Madrid, and from it daily comes an
abundant supply of that fruit, particularly
grateful in this hot climate.
I suppose that the insurgents, who
had been for three days roasting in
the shadeless desert that surrounds this
capital, needed refreshment, and eat
up all the strawberries, or else that
the want of a railway—that to Aranjuez
being partly in the hands of the
government, and partly in those of
O’Donnell, and cut in the middle—precluded
their being sent. As for
bull-fights, it was no time for them
when man-fights were going on; and
moreover, the gates of Madrid were
for several days shut—besides which,
some of the bull-fighters are said to
have joined the insurgents. The dramatic
season being at an end, and all
the theatres closed, Madrid has now
for sole amusement the insurrection,
which every day seems taking farther
from its walls, but which not impossibly
may break out again within
them. If a decided advantage were
gained by O’Donnell’s division, or if
news came that Saragossa or some
other large town had pronounced
against the government, there would
very likely be a rising in this capital.
I am assured that attempts are now
making to work upon the troops
of the garrison, and if only a few
companies could be won over and
relied upon, the government might
speedily be upset. There are in
Madrid plenty of ex-national guards,
and of men who have served in
the army, who would quickly produce
their hidden arms and rush out into
the streets, with cries of “Down with
the ministry.” It is matter of considerable
doubt whether these would
be coupled with <em>vivas</em> for the Queen.
As for the Queen-mother, I am convinced
that her life would be in danger
in the event of such an outbreak. She
is deeply detested here; the more so
as she is known to support the present
government with all the influence she
possesses over her daughter. A Madrid
revolutionary mob is dangerous,
vindictive, and bloody-minded. In
proof of this many incidents recur to
my memory, and doubtless will to
yours—amongst others, the fate of
Quesada, whose son is now military
governor here, and who was almost
torn to pieces at the country house in
the environs, whither he had fled for
shelter. His murderers returned to
Madrid, singing the dreaded <cite><span lang="es">Tragala!</span></cite>
and drank in the public cafés bowls of
coffee stirred with his severed fingers.
The revolutionary spirit is calmer
now, but it may again revive upon
occasion. No person in Spain, not
even Sartorius himself, who certainly
is sufficiently hated, is so much under
public ban as Maria Christina. She
doubtless knows it: her conscience
can hardly be easy, and her fears are
probably roused; for her approaching
departure for France is much spoken
of, and likely to take place.</p>

<p class='c009'>Since O’Donnell’s division left the
neighbourhood of Madrid, we have
heard comparatively little concerning
him. We know his route; also that
his strength has somewhat increased,
that his troops are well-disciplined
and confident of success, and that he
is at this date in Andalusia. Where
he may be, and what may have
occurred by the time you receive this
letter, it is of course impossible to
foretell; but, although ministerial bulletins
daily scatter his men to the
winds, representing them as deserting,
weary, exterminated, and, if possible,
even in worse plight, the truth is that
they are in as good order, and as ready
for service, as if they held themselves
subject to the government of the
Queen. Every possible means have
been taken by the authorities to throw
discredit upon the insurgents and upon
their leaders, by representing them as
robbers and oppressors, paying for
nothing, ill-treating the people, and
exacting forced contributions at the
bayonet’s point. “To lie like a bulletin,”
is an old saying, but it would
be at least as apt to say—“like the
<em>Madrid Gazette</em> or the <em>Heraldo</em> newspaper.”
I can well imagine how
difficult it must be in other countries
to get at the truth about Spanish
affairs, when I see the systematic
efforts made to suppress it here. Letters
are seized by wholesale in their
passage through the post-office, some
newspapers are suppressed, and others
are permitted to publish no news but
those they copy from the government
journals, which are for the most part
ingeniously embellished to suit the
purpose of the ministers; whilst sometimes
they are pure fabrications. One
of the great occupations of the official
papers, for the first few days after the
insurrection broke out, was to blacken
the character of its leaders. Dulce,
especially—who, in common with the
other generals engaged in the outbreak,
had been stripped by royal
decree of all rank, titles, and honours—was
the object of abuse
which bordered upon billingsgate.</p>

<p class='c009'>The virtuous <em>Heraldo</em> daily came
out with fierce philippics upon the
“rebel and traitor,” who had deserted
his Queen because he deemed that
she had deserted the country and
broken her oath, and who, by so doing,
had exchanged large emoluments, high
rank, and one of the best positions his
profession affords in Spain, for the uncertain
fate of an insurgent leader—perhaps,
in the end, for a short shrift
and a firing party. The men of the
<em>Heraldo</em> could not understand this;
they felt that <em>they</em> were incapable of
such conduct; in their heart of hearts
they must have thought Dulce more
remarkable as a fool than as a rebel,
but in their paper they contented
themselves with abusing him as the
latter. Inexpert with the pen, Dulce
nevertheless took it up to reply. On
the 1st of July, the day after the
drawn fight of Vicálvaro, and in a
village close to the scene of action,
he wrote a letter, whose faulty style
and soldierly abruptness are the best
evidence of its being his own unassisted
production. As a characteristic
production, and in justice to its writer,
who will doubtless be blamed by many
in foreign countries, where the facts of
the case and the extent of the sacrifices
he has made are imperfectly
known and appreciated, I give you a
translation of the letter. It is addressed
to the editors of the <em>Heraldo</em>,
and runs as follows:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Since you have allowed the publication
in your periodical of an article
referring to me personally, and to my
conduct, and as I consider that an insult
is not a reason, I trust you will
be pleased to publish my protest
against the whole of your accusation,
by doing which you will fulfil your
duty as public writers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not wish to prejudge the
issue of our enterprise; whatever
that may be it will not surprise me,
or make me repent what I have done.
That I may not be disappointed, the
worst that I expect is to die in the
field of battle or in the <i><span lang="es">Campo de
Guardias</span></i> (the place of military executions
at Madrid). Whatever occurs,
I shall have acted according to my
conscience.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I seek neither places nor honours,
for I have them in abundance. No
desire of revenge of any kind has
moved me, for I cherish neither dislike
nor resentment against the persons
composing the present government,
and much less against the
Queen. The cause of my insurrection
is entirely the memory that I have of
the oath taken by the King of Castile
when he ascends the throne. He
swears upon the Holy Scriptures to
observe and enforce the law of the
State—‘<em>and if I should not do so, I
desire not to be obeyed</em>.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“My conviction is, that the Queen
has violated her oath, and, in this
case, I prefer being guilty of <em>leze-majesty</em>
to being guilty of <em>leze-nation</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I well know that the sentiments I
have expressed will not convince you,
because they must be felt and not explained.
For my justification I appeal
to the inexorable tribunal of posterity,
and to the secret police of the consciences
of yourselves in the first place,
of the Queen herself, and of this unhappy
country.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A copy of this document is already
on the road, and will be published,
as you will see, in foreign
countries. I also send it to other
Madrid newspapers, although I believe
that a miserable fear will prevent
their publishing it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That you may never be able to
deny that I have sent you this letter,
I have had formal registry made of
it, and it perhaps will one day be
published. I trust then that you will
be sufficiently generous and gentlemanly<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c007'><sup>[29]</sup></a>
to insert it in your periodical,
by doing which you will highly oblige
me. (Signed) <span class='sc'>El General Dulce</span>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Vallecas, 1st July 1854.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The original is to be found duly
stamped in the register of this corporation,
where it has been inserted
against the will of the individuals
composing it, who are exempt from
all blame.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I need hardly say that the <em>Heraldo</em>
has not published this letter, of which
numerous copies have been distributed
in Madrid by friends of its writer,
and by persons who believe that, as
he himself says, he has “acted according
to his conscience (<i><span lang="es">dado una satisfaccion
à mi conciencia</span></i>), and who admire
his disinterestedness—the rarest
quality amongst public men in Spain.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is not easy to foretell the result of
this insurrection, which has now lasted
for fifteen days without any decisive
or even important event. The
country, taken by surprise, and ignorant
of the objects of the outbreak—which
it suspected to have been
made merely to bring about a change
of men, but not of system—looked on
at first with apathy. O’Donnell’s
greatest error was the first proclamation
he issued, which, in many words,
said nothing and held out no prospect
of advantage to the people. Another
has just appeared, short, pithy, explicit,
and calculated to satisfy the liberal
party. It promises the Spanish nation
the benefits of the representative
system, for which it has shed so much
of its blood and made so many sacrifices,
as yet without result.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is time,” it continues, “to say
what we propose doing on the day of
victory. We desire the preservation
of the throne, but without the camarilla
that dishonours it; the rigorous
enforcement of the fundamental laws,
improving them, especially those of
elections and of the press; a diminution
of taxation, founded on strict
economy; respect to seniority and
merit in the civil and military services.
We desire to relieve the towns from
the centralising system that consumes
them, giving them the local independence
necessary to preserve and increase
their own interests; and, as a
guarantee of all these things, we desire
the <span class='sc'>National Militia</span>, and will
plant it on a solid basis. Such are our
intentions, which we frankly express,
but without imposing them upon the
nation. The juntas of government
that are to be constituted in the free
provinces, the general Cortes that are
soon to be assembled, the nation itself,
in short, shall fix the definitive
bases of the liberal regeneration to
which we aspire. We devote our
swords to the national will, and sheathe
them only when it is fulfilled.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This proclamation is dated from
Manzanaris, the 7th July, and is signed
by O’Donnell. You will observe that
no mention is made in it of the Queen.
It is monarchical, because it desires
to “preserve the throne;” but it by no
means pledges those who publish it
to retain Isabella II. The promise to
arm the national guard is the most
important that it contains, since that
is the only guarantee the Liberals can
have for the fulfilment of the other
pledges. It may possibly induce the
Progresistas, who hitherto have scarcely
stirred in the business, to take active
measures. Meanwhile we hear of
risings and armed bands in various
parts of the country, and persons familiar
with Spanish revolutions, and
who have witnessed many of them,
notice signs of fermentation, which
prove the insurrectionary spirit to be
spreading—a bubble here and there
on water, indicating that it will presently
boil. When O’Donnell’s proclamation
gets spread abroad, and its
purport known, it is quite possible
that large towns or districts may declare
for the insurgents. In Spain,
however, it is most difficult to speculate
on coming events, for it is the
land of the unforeseen—<i><span lang="fr">le pays de l’imprévu</span></i>—and
I shall not attempt to
play the prophet, for, if I did, perhaps,
before my letter reached you,
the electric telegraph would have
proved me a false one. Moreover,
I have no time to add much more,
for I well know that you, Ebony,
will grumble, if this letter does not
reach you somewhere about the twentieth
of the month. Moreover, the
horses of Maga’s foreign-service messenger
neigh with impatience, and the
escort which is to accompany him on
the first stage of his journey is
already formed up. For the roads
are far from safe just now, thanks to
the concentration of the gendarmes,
(who usually keep excellent order
upon them), to do duty in the capital,
or pursue the insurgents. We hear
of various bands appearing—north,
south, and east—some calling themselves
Carlists, others Republicans,
but in either case probably not pleasant
to meet on the road; and besides
those there are smaller parties who
do not aspire to a political character,
and are abroad simply for their own
behoof and advantage, and, I need
not say, for the disadvantage of the
travellers they may chance to encounter.
As for sending letters of
the nature and importance of this one
by the ordinary channel of Her Catholic
Majesty’s mails, one would do
better to abstain from writing them,
as the chances would be fifty to one
against their ever reaching their destination.
One might almost as well
throw them into the fire as into the
marble lion’s mouth that yawns at
the <i><span lang="es">casa de correos</span></i>,—as if to warn
people of the dangers their correspondence
runs. Were I to consign this
epistle to leo’s jaws, I should not expect
it ever to go farther than to the
Graham-department of the Madrid
post-office.</p>

<p class='c009'>Although you will have gathered
from the newspapers the principal
events, and some of the minor particulars
of the insurrection of 1854—as
far as it has as yet gone—this sketch
of it, however imperfect, from an eyewitness,
will, I trust, interest you.
Spanish revolutions and insurrections
rarely resemble each other; every
successive outbreak has a character
of its own, distinct from that of its
predecessors. And that of the 28th
of last month has peculiar features,
which I have endeavoured to portray.
If my letter has no other merit, it
will, I think, bring its readers, concisely,
without much detail, but with
perfect truth, up to the present point
of Spanish politics. Should aught
worth relating occur whilst I am
within the boundaries of Queen Isabel’s
dominions, rely upon my keeping
you duly informed. Meanwhile,
may Providence preserve you, in your
happy Land of Cakes, alike from military
revolts, and from popular <em>pronunciamientos</em>.
So prays, from his
exile <i><span lang="la">in partibus</span></i>, your faithful</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>THE ETHNOLOGY OF EUROPE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“There were brave men before
Agamemnon,”—heroes before there
was a Homer to sing them, says that
prince of sensible poets, Horace. It
is not less true that there were nations
before history—communities, races,
of which the eye of civilisation never
caught a glimpse. In some cases,
before the light of history broke in
upon their seclusion, these old types
of mankind, losing their individuality,
had become merged in a succeeding
and mightier wave of population; in
others they had wholly disappeared,—they
had lived and fought and died
in perfect isolation from every focus
of civilisation, and left not even a
floating legend behind them in the
world. Man’s mortality—the destiny
of the individual to pass away from
earth like a vapour, making room for
others, heirs of his wisdom and unimbued
with his prejudices—is the
most familiar of truths; but the mortality
of nations, the death of races,
is a conception which at first staggers
us. That a family should grow into
a nation,—that from the loins of one
man should descend a seed like unto
the sands on the sea-shore for multitude,
appears to our everyday senses
as a natural consequence; but that
nations should dwindle down to families,
and families into solitary individuals,
until death gets all, and
earth has swallowed up a whole phase
of humanity, is a thought the grandeur
of which is felt to be solemn, if not
appalling. The conception, however,
need not be a strange one. Facts,
which reconcile us to everything, are
testifying to its truth even at the present
day. It is not long since the
Guanches in the Canary Islands, that
last specimen of what may once have
been a race, and the Guarras in Brazil,
dwindled out of existence in their
last asylum,—expiring at the feet of
the more lordly race which the fulness
of time brought to their dwellings.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not to mention the Miaou-tse in
China, and other relics of Asiatic
races, the same phenomenon is more
impressively presented to us among
the Red Men of America, where the
old race is seen dying out beneath our
very eyes. Year by year they are
melting away. Of the millions which
once peopled the vast regions on this
side of the Mississippi River, all have
vanished, but a few scattered families;
and it is as clear as the sun at noonday,
that in a few generations more,
the last of the Red Men will be numbered
with the dead. Why, is it
asked, are they thus doomed? In
the suburbs of Mobile, or wandering
through its streets, you will see the
remnant of the Choctaw tribe, covered
with nothing but blankets, and living
in bark tents, scarcely a degree advanced
above the beasts of the field.
No philanthropy can civilise them,—no
ingenuity can induce them to do
an honest day’s work. The life of the
woods is struck from them,—the white
man has taken their hunting-grounds;
and they live on helpless as in a
dream, quietly abiding their time.
They are stationary, they will not advance;
and, like everything stationary,
the world is sweeping away.
They sufficed for the first phase of
humanity in the New World. As
long as there was only need for man
to be lord of the woods and of the
animal creation, the Red Man did
well; but no sooner did the call come
for him to perfect himself, and change
the primeval forest into gardens, than
the Red Man knew, by mysterious
instinct, that his mission was over,—and
either allowed himself, in sheer
apathy, to sink out of existence among
the pitiless feet of the new-comers, or
died fighting fiercely with the apostle
of a civilisation which he hated but
could not comprehend.</p>

<p class='c009'>Far back in the history of Europe
and of our own country—or rather,
we should say, in periods entirely pre-historic—it
is now known that a similar
disappearance of a human race has
taken place. Celt and Teuton, we
fancy, were the first occupiers of Europe,—but
the case is not so. A
wave or waves of population had preceded
even them; and as we dig down
into the soil beneath us, ever and anon
we come upon strange and startling
traces of those primeval occupants of
the land. In those natural museums
of the past, the caves and peat-bogs of
Europe, the keen-witted archæologists
of present times are finding abundant
relics of a race dissimilar from all the
human varieties of which written history
takes cognisance. The researches
of Wilson among the peat-bogs of the
British Isles have brought to light
traces of no less than two distinct pre-Celtic
races inhabiting the land,—one
of which had the skull of a singularly
broad and short, square and compact
form, while the head of the other
race was long and very narrow, or
“boat-shaped.” The exhumations
of Retzius show that precisely similar
races once inhabited Scandinavia.
The caves and ossuaries of
Franconia and Upper Saxony prove
that in Central Europe, also, there
were races before the advent of the
Celts; and the researches of Boucher
de Perthes, amid the alluvial stratifications
of the river Somme, indicate a
not less ancient epoch for the cinerary
urns, bones, and instruments of a primordial
people in France.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here,” says M. de Perthes, “we
naturally inquire, who were these mysterious
primitive inhabitants of Gaul? We
are told that this part of Europe is of
modern origin, or at least of recent population.
Its annals scarcely reach to
twenty centuries, and even its traditions
do not exceed two thousand five hundred
years. The various people who are
known to history as having occupied it—the
Gauls, the Celts, the Veneti, Ligurians,
Iberians, Cimbrians, and Scythians
have left no vestiges to which we can
assign that date. The traces of those
[originally] nomadic tribes who ravaged
Gaul scarcely precede the Christian era
by a few centuries. Was Gaul, then, a
desert, a solitude, before this period?
Was its sun less genial, or its soil less
fertile? Were not its hills as pleasant,
and its plains and valleys as ready for the
harvest? Or, if men had not yet learned to
plough and sow, were not its rivers filled
with fish, and its forests with game?
And, if the land abounded with everything
calculated to attract and support a
population, why should it not have been
inhabited? The absence of great ruins,
indeed, indicates that Gaul at this period,
and even much later, had not attained a
great degree of civilisation, nor been the
seat of powerful kingdoms; but why
should it not have had its towns and villages?—or
rather, why should it not, like
the steppes of Russia, the prairies and
virgin forests of America, and the fertile
plains of Africa, have been overrun from
time immemorial by tribes of men—savages,
perhaps, but nevertheless united in
families if not in nations?”</p>

<p class='c008'>We shall not dwell at present upon
the relics of these races who have thus
preceded all history, and vanished into
their graves before a civilised age could
behold them. We shall not accompany
M. de Perthes in his various excavations,
nor, after passing through
the first stratum of soil, and coming
to the relics of the middle ages, see
him meet subsequently, in regular
order, with traces of the Roman and
Celtic periods, until at last he comes
upon weapons, utensils, figures, signs
and symbols, which must have been
the work of a surpassingly ancient
people. We need not describe his
discovery of successive beds of bones
and ashes, separated from each other
by strata of turf and tufa, with no less
than five different stages of cinerary
urns, belonging to distinct generations,
of which the oldest were deposited
below the woody or diluvian turf,—nor
the coarse structure of these vases
(made by hand and dried in the sun),
nor the rude utensils of bone, or
roughly-carved stone, by which they
were surrounded.<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c007'><sup>[30]</sup></a> Neither need we
do more than allude to the remains
of a fossil whale recently exhumed
in Blair Drummond moss, (twenty
miles from the nearest point of the
river Forth where, by any possibility,
a whale could nowadays be
stranded), having beside it a rude
harpoon of deer’s horn—speaking
plainly of the coexistence, in these
remote pre-Celtic times, of human inhabitants.
Even above ground there
are striking relics scattered over Europe
which it would be hazardous to
assign to any race known to history.
Those circles of upright stones, of
which Stonehenge is the most familiar
example, date back to an unknown
antiquity. They are found throughout
Europe, from Norway to the
Mediterranean; and manifestly they
must have been erected by a numerous
people, and faithful exponents of
a general sentiment, since we find
them in so many countries. They are
commonly called Celtic or Druidic;
not because they were raised originally
by Druids, but because they had been
used in the Druidical worship, though
erected, it may be, for other uses, or
dedicated to other divinities,—even
as the temples of Paganism afterwards
served for the solemnities of Christianity.
All that we know is, that,
having neither date nor inscription,
they must be older than written language,—for
a people who can write
never leave their own names or exploits
unchronicled. The ancients
were as ignorant on this matter as
ourselves; even tradition is silent;
and, at the period of the Roman invasion,
the origin of those monuments
was already shrouded in obscurity.
A revolution, therefore, must have intervened
between the time of their
erection and the advent of the Legions;
and what revolution could it be in
those days save a revolution of race?
“The Celtæ,” says Dr Wilson, “are
by no means to be regarded as the
primal heirs of the land, but are, on
the contrary, comparatively recent intruders.
Ages before their migration
into Europe, an unknown Allophylian
race had wandered to this remote
island of the sea, and in its turn gave
place to later Allophylian nomades,
also destined to occupy it only for a
time. Of these ante-historical nations,
archæology alone reveals any traces.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Passing from this strange and solemn
spectacle of the death and utter
extinction of human races, once living
and enjoying themselves amidst those
very scenes where we ourselves now
pant and revel in the drama of existence,—let
us look upon the face of
Europe as it appears when first the
light of history broke upon it. Since
then, there have been remarkable declines,
but no extinction of races. As
if war and rivalry were a permanent
attribute of the species, when the
curtain first rises upon Europe, it is
a struggle of races that is discernible
through the gloom. A dark-skinned
race, long settled in the land, are
fighting doggedly with a fair-skinned
race of invaders from the East.
The dark-skins were worsted, but
still survive—definitely in detached
groups, and indefinitely as a leaven
to entire populations. That dark-skinned
race have been called Iberians,—the
fair-skinned new-comers
were the Indo-Germans, headed by
the Gaels or Celts. When the two
races first met in Europe—the <em>blond</em>
from the south-east, meeting the <em>dark</em>
in the west—they encountered each
other as natural enemies, and a severe
struggle ensued. The Celts finally
forced their way into Spain, and
established themselves there,—became
more or less amalgamated with
the darker occupants, and were called
<em>Celt-Iberians</em>. Ever since, these two
opposite types have been commingling
throughout Western Europe; but a
complete fusion has not even yet
taken place, and the types of each
are still traceable in certain localities.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was thus an Iberian world
before there was a Celtic world. One
of the pre-Celtic populations of the
British Isles was probably Iberian;
and their type, besides leavening indefinitely
a portion of the present
population, is still distinctly traceable
in many of the dark-haired, dark-eyed,
and dark-skinned Irish, as well
as occasionally in Great Britain itself.
The Basques, protected by their Pyrenean
fastnesses, are a still existent
group of nearly pure Iberians; and of
their tongue, termed Euskaldune by
its speakers, Duponceau long ago
said:—“This language, preserved in
a corner of Europe, by a few thousand
mountaineers, is the sole remaining
fragment of perhaps a hundred
dialects, constructed on the same
plan, which probably existed and
were universally spoken, at a remote
period, in that quarter of the world.
Like the bones of the mammoth, and
the relics of unknown races which have
perished, it remains a monument of
the destruction brought by a succession
of ages. It stands single and
alone of its kind, surrounded by idioms
whose modern construction bears no
analogy to it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Bretons form another isolated
but less distinct group of still existent
Iberians. To this day they present a
striking contrast to the population
around them, who are of tall stature,
with blue eyes, white skins, and blond
hair—communicative, impetuous, versatile—passing
rapidly from courage
to timidity, and from audacity to despair;—in
other words, presenting the
distinctive character of the Celtic race,
now, as in the ancient Gauls. The
Bretons are entirely different. They are
taciturn—hold strongly to their ideas
and usages—are persevering and of
melancholic temperament;—in a word,
both in <em>morale</em> and <em>physique</em>, they
present the type of a southern race.
And this brings us to the question—whence
came these Iberians? M.
Bodichon, a surgeon distinguished for
fifteen years in the French army of
Algeria, observes that persons who
have lived in Brittany, and then go to
Algeria, are struck with the resemblance
which they discover between
the ancient Armoricans (the Bretons)
and the Cabyles of northern Africa.
“In fact, the moral and physical character
of the two races is identical.
The Breton of pure blood has a bony
head, light-yellow complexion of
bistre tinge, eyes black or brown, stature
short, and the black hair of the
Cabyle. Like him, he instinctively
hates strangers. In both, the same
perverseness and obstinacy, the same
endurance of fatigue, same love of
independence, same inflexion of voice,
same expression of feelings. Listen to
a Cabyle speaking his native tongue,
and you will think you hear a Breton
talking Celtic.” Impressed with this
resemblance, M. Bodichon was induced
to reflect on the subject, and
at last came to the conclusion that
the Berbers who primally peopled
Northern Africa, and the dark-skinned
Iberians of Western Europe, belonged
to the same race. He thinks that, as
Europe and Africa were once united at
their western extremities, previous to
the convulsion which produced the
Straits of Gibraltar, this Iberian population
passed into Spain by this primeval
isthmus, and thence diffused themselves
over Western Europe and its
isles. Whether this were actually the
case, it is hard to say; but it is important
to note that Sallust, quoting
“the Punic books which were ascribed
to King Hiempsal,” exactly reverses
the course of migration, and states
that the progenitors of the African
Moors were Medians and Persians
who had marched through Europe
into Spain, and thence into Mauritania—though
whether overland by
the isthmus, or by boats across the
strait, is still left to conjecture. Prichard
thinks the Libyans and Iberians
were distinct races, but owns that
they were found intermingling in the
islands and along the western shores
of the Mediterranean. Of course it
may be taken for granted that
among these Iberians thus spread
over Africa, Spain, France, and the
British Isles, local differences would
exist—just as there is a perceptible
difference between the Anglo-Saxons
of the Old World and those of the
New; but there is little doubt that
the <i><span lang="la">Scoti</span></i> of Ireland, the Iberians of
Spain, and the Berbers of Africa, belonged
to a fundamentally identical
race.</p>

<p class='c009'>How any race first came into a
country, is a matter of little moment,
especially when the epoch of their
arrival so far transcends the dawn of
history as does that of the Iberians.
Even the first wave of the Celtic
migration had reached the West before
any scrutiny of their progress was
possible; for when tradition first dimly
opens upon Gaul, about 1500 <span class='fss'>B. C.</span>,
its territory was occupied by these
two primitive and distinctly-marked
Caucasian races—the Celts and Iberians:
the one fair-skinned and light-haired,
the other a dark race; and
each speaking a language bearing no
affinity to that of the other—precisely
as the Euskaldune of the present
Basques is unintelligible to Gaelic
tribes of Lower Brittany. Some of
the subsequent waves of Celtic or
Scythic migration come within the
ken of history; and it is remarkable
that the line of march which these
followed, after passing the shores of
the Black Sea, seems to have been
along the “Riphæan Valley,” which
lay to the north of the Carpathian
mountains, and stretched to the Baltic.
Now, if we look at the contour
map of Europe in <cite>Johnston’s
Physical Atlas</cite>, we see a narrow strip
of the lowest elevation extending
from the Black Sea to the Baltic—nowhere
rising to the second line of
elevation, <em>i.e.</em> more than 150 and less
than 300 feet above the level of the
sea,—and turning to the geological
map, we find that this same tract is
overlaid with recent diluvial deposits.
We know that the Scandinavian region
is rising, and it is probable
that all the plain of Sarmatia has
partaken of the elevation,—and before
the barriers of the Thracian
Bosphorus burst, it is quite certain
that the waters of the Caspian, the
Euxine, and the Baltic were united
by that “ocean-river” of which
Homer, Hesiod, and all the old bards
sing, and by sailing along which, both
the Argonauts and Ulysses are reported
to have passed northwards
into the western ocean. The existence
of this vast belt of water, stretching
from the southmost point of the
Baltic to the Caucasus, is probably
one reason why the Slavonians were
late of appearing in southern Europe,
and why no sprinkling of them or of the
Mongols is to be found among the early
settlers of South-western Europe.
All the early migrations into Europe
proceeded from Caucasian or sub-Caucasian
regions—a circumstance
which, considering the known simultaneous
existence of roving hordes
and a great population on the Mongolian
plains, can hardly be accounted
for on the supposition that the face of
Eastern Europe has since then undergone
no change. But on the supposition
we make, the chain of the Ural
Mountains and this large Mediterranean
basin would for long act as restraints
upon any tendency of the
Mongolian population to move westward,
or of the Slavonians to move
southwards.<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c007'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The next wave of population which
flowed westwards was the Cimbri or
Cimmerians,—a people cognate to
the Celts or Gaels, yet by no
means closely related. About the
seventh century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, as may be inferred
from Herodotus, a clan of this
race abandoned the Tauric Chersonese,
and marched westwards,—this
Cimbrian migration, however,
like most others, not being conducted
in one mass, but by successive
and sometimes widely-severed
movements. Three centuries afterwards
we find the Cimbri on the
shores of the Northern Ocean in Jutland;
and between the years 113 and
101 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, we find the race all on the
move, and setting out on that southward
career of devastation which
eventually brought them into Gaul,
Spain, and Italy. The Belgians seem
to have been a Cimbrian tribe which
had preceded the main body; for
when, in this invasion, the Cimbri
reached Northern Gaul, the Belgæ
immediately joined them as allies
against the Celts,—and it seems also
proven that the Cimbri and Belgæ
spoke dialects of the same language.
The Celts, routed by the invaders,
were impelled to the south and east,
doubtless trespassing in turn upon
the dark-skinned Iberians. It was immediately
after this inroad that Cæsar
and his Romans entered Gaul, and
commenced his Commentaries with
the well-known statement:—“All
Gaul is divided into three parts, of
which one is inhabited by the Belgians,
[or Cimbri, in the north]—another
by the Aquitanians [or Iberians,
in the south-west],—and the
third [or eastern], by those who in
their own language, call themselves
Celts, and who in our tongue are
called Gael (<em>Galli</em>). These races
differ among themselves by their
language, their manners, and their
laws.” Previous to this time the
Teutons had settled in central Europe,
and in alliance with Celtic tribes
made incursions into Italy.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have now reached a period at
which the population of Europe becomes
greatly mixed, in consequence
of the constant rovings and incursions
of the various races and tribes of
which it was composed. It is interesting
to note the effect of such a state
of things upon the physical characteristics
of the people. And first it is
to be observed, that, with extremely
rare exceptions, conquest is not attended
by extermination. When one
people, even in semi-barbarous times,
conquers another, it does not annihilate
and rarely displaces, but for the
most part only overlays it. The annihilating
process, of which a sample
may be seen in America, only takes
place in the rare case of the meeting
of two nations, in such widely different
states of civilisation as to render
amalgamation impossible,—and even
in this case only when the inferior
race is so intractable as to resist all
obedience to the superior. <em>Displacement</em>—which
is obsolete now, since
advancing civilisation has rendered
conquest political only—was pretty
common two thousand years ago,
when Europe was thinly and nomadically
peopled, and tribes migrated <em>en
masse</em>. In this way, for example, the
Cimbri wedged themselves in among
the Celts in Northern Gaul, and took
possession of a large tract in Northern
Italy. But soon after the Christian era—chiefly
in consequence of the increasing
density and settled habits of the
population—conquest ceased to produce
either extermination or displacement,
and consisted merely in the
overlaying of one population by another
much less numerous but more
powerful. Thus the Normans in England
and the Franks in Gaul were
but a handful compared to the conquered
population; and consequently,
though they might give their laws
and even their name to the country,
they could not materially alter the
physical character of the people.</p>

<p class='c009'>The chief influence which, in the
case of two races mingling, determines
the preservation or extinction
of types or national features, is simply
the numerical proportion existing between
the two races thus amalgamating.
When races meet and mix on
equal terms, and with no natural repugnance
to each other (in other words,
<i><span lang="la">cæteris paribus</span></i>), the relative number
of the two races decides the question—the
type of the smaller number, in
this hypothetical case, inevitably disappearing
in the long run. Take, for
example, a thousand white families
and fifty black ones—place them on
an island, and let them regularly intermarry;
and the result would be,
that in the course of time the black
type would disappear, although there
is reason to believe that traces of it
would “crop out” during a very long
period. And if two fair-skinned races
were brought into contact in a similar
manner, and in similar proportions,
the extermination of the less numerous
one would be even sooner effected.
The operation of this law is well illustrated
in the lower animals. Cross
two domestic animals of different
breeds—take the offspring and cross
it with one of the parent stocks, and
continue this process for a few generations,
and the result is that the one
becomes swallowed up in the other.
This is the theory; but in the actual
world races never intermarry with
such theoretical regularity and indifference.
Each community of mankind
has, as its conservative element, a
tendency to form unions within its
own limits; and if a foreign element
is once introduced into a population,
the operation of this predilection tends
to preserve the type of the lesser
number for a much longer period than
mere theory would assign to it. The
stranger-hating and obstinate-tempered
Bretons and Basques, for instance,
by intermarrying among themselves,
have thus preserved the type
of the old Iberians through three
thousand years, although surrounded
on all sides by the fair-haired Celts.
In the case of a conquering race like
the Franks and Normans, there is
generally less isolation than this; but
then, the way in which the amalgamation
between the conquerors and the
conquered takes place, is such as to
give a great advantage to the former.
The sons of the conquerors may wed
the daughters of the conquered, for
the sake of their lands; but it is comparatively
seldom that the daughters
of the invaders will condescend to
tarnish their scutcheon by becoming
wedded to and merged in the class of
the vanquished. The principle of
caste is all-pervading, even when
nominally repudiated; and thus, as
the male ever influences most directly
the type of the offspring, a small
number of conquerors may for long
perpetuate their line in comparative
purity, even though surrounded by
myriads of a different race.</p>

<p class='c009'>From all this it results, that when
a small body of foreigners is shot into
the middle of a large population, as it
were in virtue of a mere casual impetus,
and not owing to higher qualities
and organisation on the part of the
aliens, the new-comers are quickly absorbed
into the general mass of the
population, and their type, in course
of time, wholly disappears. The history
of Italy throws important light
upon this subject. Successive hordes
of barbarians broke into and overran
that country, powerful from their rude
energy, but numerically weak, and
inferior in mental condition to the
conquered race. Again and again did
human waves of Visigoths, Vandals,
Huns, Herules, Ostrogoths, Lombards,
and Normans roll in succession
over the Italian plains; and even the
Saracens for a time held possession of
some of its fairest provinces; yet what
vestiges remain in Italy of these barbarian
surges? The first three passed
over it like tornados; the two next,
after contending with the Goths, were
expelled from the land; and of the
whole conglomerate mass but small
fragments were left, too insignificant
to materially influence the native Italic
types. The Lombards, indeed, remained,
and implanted their name on
a portion of the peninsula; but, with
this fragmentary exception, the aboriginal
population of Italy has remained
unaltered in blood and features since
the early times when the Celts and
Cimbri made settlements in its northern
provinces. And thus the normal
law is fulfilled, in the invaders being
swallowed up in the mass of the native
population,—leavening it, of course,
more or less, but ever tending towards
ultimate extinction.</p>

<p class='c009'>When a really conquering race,
however—one superior alike in physical
and mental power to the subjugated
population—invades a country,
and, instead of being expelled,
or passing onwards like a transient
whirlwind, continues to hold the
realm in virtue of superior power,
such a race, as we have said, may long
and almost indelibly perpetuate their
features in the land. In such a case
they in reality, if not in name, form
a caste; each one of the invaders becomes
a noble; and when they make
exceptions to the practice of intermarrying
among themselves, it is only
that they may more widely diffuse
their lineaments, by forming matrimonial
or other unions with the female
portion of the native race.<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c007'><sup>[32]</sup></a> Thus the
feudalism of the all-conquering Normans
was a system of caste, by means
of which they long maintained the
purity and pre-eminence of their race
in the countries which they conquered;
as may best be seen in French
history, where the <i><span lang="fr">vieux noblesse</span></i>, even
in 1789, were the lineal descendants
of the soldiers of Clovis; and where
the distinction between <em>noble</em> and <em>roturier</em>
was kept up with such rigid and
antiquated pertinacity, that at length
the Celtic population, becoming more
and more developed alike in intellect
and resources, threw off the whole
foreign system like an incubus, and
returned to those principles of equality
and volatility in government which
distinguished their ancestors of old
Gaul.</p>

<p class='c009'>We may remark in conclusion, on
this topic, that the ascendancy of certain
families of mankind is due not
only to their superior physical, but
even more to their superior mental
organisation, which ever keeps them
uppermost, and enables them to mate
themselves with whom they please.
It is a remarkable fact, as illustrative
of the native vigour of some races,
that there is not a head in Christendom
which <em>legitimately</em> wears a crown—not
a single family in Europe whose
blood is acknowledged to be royal,
but traces its genealogy to that Norman
colossus, <span class='sc'>William</span> the <span class='sc'>Conqueror</span>.
This has been well shown
by M. Paulmier;<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c007'><sup>[33]</sup></a> but we may add, as
a curiosity which lately attracted our
own notice, when looking at the portrait
of the Conqueror—namely, that
a strong resemblance exists between
his fine and massive features and those
of the present Czar of Russia. Both are
distinguished by the same broad brow
and arched eyebrows (not each forming
a semicircle, as seems to be the
meaning of the term “arched” when
applied to eyebrows nowadays, but
both combining to form an oval curve,
vaulting over the under part of the
face, as was the meaning among the
Greeks), the same thick straight nose,
and the same massive and beautiful
conformation in the bones of the jaw
and chin. The face of the Czar, however,
we must add, is not equal in
solid strength and intellect to that of
his great progenitor.</p>

<p class='c009'>The operation of these physiological
laws upon the population of Europe
has been interestingly illustrated by
the recent researches of a French
naturalist of high reputation, M. Edwards.
This gentleman, after perusing
Thierry’s <cite>History of the Gauls</cite>,
made a tour through France, Belgium,
Switzerland, and Italy, engaged in
careful study of the present population
in relation to the ancient settlers;
and he asserts that now, after the
lapse of two thousand years, the types
of the Cimbri, the Celts, and Iberians
are still distinctly traceable among
their living descendants, in the very
localities where history first descries
these early families. Of the inland
eastern parts of France, tenanted of
old by the Gauls proper, and which
were never penetrated into by the
Cimbri, who took quiet possession of
their outskirts, M. Edwards thus
speaks:—“In traversing, from north
to south, the part of France which
corresponds to Oriental Gaul—viz.,
Burgundy, Lyons, Dauphiny, and
Savoy—I have distinguished that
type, so well marked, which ethnographers
have assigned to the Gauls.”
That is to say, “the head is so round
as to approach the spherical form;
the forehead is moderate, slightly
protuberant, and receding towards
the temples; eyes large and open;
the nose, from its depression at its
commencement to its termination, almost
straight—that is to say, without
any marked curve; its extremity is
rounded, as well as the chin; the
stature medium;—the features thus
being quite in harmony with the form
of the head.” Of the northern part of
ancient Gaul, the principal seat of the
Belgæ or Cimbri, he says:—“I traversed
a great part of the <i><span lang="la">Gallia Belgica</span></i>
of Cæsar, from the mouth of the
Somme to that of the Seine; and here
I distinguished for the first time the
assemblage of features which constitutes
the other type, and often to such
an exaggerated degree that I was
very forcibly struck,—the long head,
the broad high forehead, the curved
nose, with the point below, and the
wings tucked up; the chin boldly
developed; and the stature tall.” In
the other parts of France (exclusive
of the south and west, anciently occupied
by the Iberians), M. Edwards
found that the Cimbrian type had
been overcome by the round heads
and straight noses of the Gauls, who
were the more numerous because the
more ancient race in those parts, and
had covered the whole country before
the arrival of the Cimbrians.</p>

<p class='c009'>Passing into Italy, he continues his
examinations. “Whatever may have
been the anterior state of matters,” he
says, “it is certain, from Thierry’s
researches and the unanimous accord
of all historians, that the <i><span lang="fr">Peuples
Gaulois</span></i> have predominated in the
north of Italy, between the Alps and
the Apennines. We find them established
there at the first dawn of
history; and the most authentic testimony
represents them with all the
character of a great nation, from this
remote period down to a very advanced
point of Roman history. This
is all I need to trouble myself about.
I know the features of their compatriots
in Transalpine Gaul—I find
them again in Cisalpine Gaul.” The
old “Gallic” settlers in northern
Italy appear to have been Cimbrian.
After describing the well-known head
of Dante—which is long and narrow,
with a high and developed forehead,
nose long and curved, with sharp
point and elevated wings—M. Edwards
says that he was struck by the
great frequency of this type in Tuscany
(although a mixed Roman type is there
the prevailing one) among the peasantry;
in the statues and busts of the Medici
family; and also amongst the effigies
and bas-reliefs of the illustrious
men of the republic of Florence. This
type is well marked since the time of
Dante, as doubtless long before. It
extends to Venice; and in the ducal
palace, M. Edwards had occasion to
observe that it is common among the
doges. The type became more predominant
as he approached Milan, and
thence he traced it as to its fountain
into Transalpine Gaul. The physical
characteristics of the present population,
therefore, correspond with the
statements of history, and show that
the ancient type of this widespread
people, the Cimbri, has survived the
lapse and vicissitudes of two thousand
years.</p>

<p class='c009'>In passing through Florence, M.
Edwards took occasion to visit the Ducal
Gallery, to study the ancient Roman
type,—selecting, by preference,
the busts of the early Roman emperors,
because they were descendants of ancient
families. Augustus, Tiberius,
Germanicus, Claudius, Nero, Titus,
&#38;c., exemplify this type in the Florentine
collections; and the family resemblance
is so close, and the style of
features so remarkable, that they cannot
be mistaken. The following is his
description:—“The vertical diameter
of the head is short, and, consequently,
the face broad. As the summit of the
cranium is flattened, and the lower
margin of the jaw-bone almost horizontal,
the contour of the head, when
viewed in front, approaches a square.
The lateral parts, above the ears, are
protuberant; the forehead low; the
nose truly aquiline—that is to say, the
curve commences near the top and
ends before it reaches the point, so
that the base is horizontal; the chin
is round; and the stature short.” This
is the characteristic type of a Roman;
but we cannot expect now to meet with
absolute uniformity in any race, however
seemingly pure. Such a type M.
Edwards subsequently found to predominate
in Rome, and certain parts of
Italy, at the present day. It is the original
type of the central portions of
the peninsula, and, however overlayed
at times, has swallowed up all intruders.
As a singular corroboration of
the French ethnographer’s observations,
Mr J. C. Nott, an American
surgeon and naturalist, says:—“A
sailor came to my office, a few months
ago, to have a dislocated arm set.
When stripped and standing before
me, he presented the type described
by M. Edwards so perfectly, and
moreover combined with such extraordinary
development of bone and
muscle, that there occurred to my
mind at once the beau-ideal of a Roman
soldier. Though the man had
been an American sailor for twenty
years, and spoke English without
foreign accent, I could not help asking
where he was born. He replied in a
deep strong voice, ‘In <em>Rome</em>, sir!’”<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c007'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>In Greece the Hellenes and Pelasgi
are two races identified with the earliest
traditions of the country; but
when we appeal to history for their
origin, or seek for the part that each
has played in the majestic drama of
antiquity, there is little more than conjecture
to guide us. Greece did not
come fairly within the scope of M.
Edwards’ researches, yet he has ventured
a few note-worthy observations
in connection with this point. He
thinks the same principles that governed
his examination of Gaul may
be applied to Greece; and that the
Hellenes and Pelasgi might be followed
ethnologically like the Celts and
Cimbri. Perhaps the most important
remark which he makes is that which
refers to the differences between what
he calls the <em>heroic</em> and <em>historic</em>—or
what is generally termed the ideal and
real types of the Greek countenance.
The ancient monuments of art in
Greece exhibit a wide diversity of
types, and this at every period of their
history. Of the two great classes into
which these may be divided, M. Edwards
says:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Most of the divinities and personages
of the <em>heroic</em> times are formed on that
well-known model which constitutes what
we term the beau-ideal. The forms and
proportions of the head and countenance
are so regular that we may describe them
with mathematical precision. A perfectly
oval contour, forehead and nose straight,
without depression between them, would
suffice to distinguish this type. The harmony
is such that the presence of these
traits implies the others. But such is not
the character of the personages of truly <em>historic</em>
times. The philosophers, orators,
warriors, and poets almost all differ from
it, and form a group apart. It cannot be
confounded with the rest: it is sufficient
to point it out, for one to recognise at
once how far it is separated. It greatly
resembles, on the contrary, the type which
is seen in other countries of Europe,
while the former is scarcely met with
there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This observation is just. The head
of Alexander the Great is nearly allied
to the pure classical or heroic
type; but this case is an exception—and
the lineaments of Lycurgus, Eratosthenes,
and most other specimens
of old Greek portrait-sculpture, are,
with the exception of the beard (if indeed
such an exception is now requisite),
very much like those which
one meets with daily in our streets.
“Were we to judge solely by the
monuments of Greece,” continues M.
Edwards, “on account of this contrast,
we should be tempted to regard
the type of the fabulous or heroic personages
as ideal. But imagination
more readily creates monsters than
models of beauty; and this principle
alone will suffice to convince us that
such a type has existed in Greece,
and the countries where its population
has spread, if it does not still exist
there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In corroboration of this conjecture,
it may be stated that the learned
travellers, M.M. de Stackelberg and de
Bronsted, who have journeyed through
the Morea and closely examined the
population, assert that the <em>heroic</em> type
is still extant in certain localities. M.
Poqueville likewise assures us that
the models which inspired Phidias and
Apelles are still to be found among
the inhabitants of the Morea. “They
are generally tall, and finely formed;
their eyes are full of fire, and they
have a beautiful mouth, ornamented
with the finest teeth. There are,
however, degrees in their beauty,
though all may be generally termed
handsome. The Spartan woman is
fair, of a slender make, but with a
noble air. The women of Taÿgetus
have the carriage of a Pallas when
she wielded her formidable ægis in
the midst of a battle. The Messenian
woman is low of stature, and distinguished
for her <em>embonpoint</em>,” (this
may be owing to a mixture with the
primitive race of the Morea, who, as
Helots, long existed as a distinct caste
in Messenia); “she has regular features,
large blue eyes, and long black
hair. The Arcadian, in her coarse
woollen garments, scarcely suffers the
symmetry of her form to appear; but
her countenance is expressive of innocence
and purity of mind.” In the
time of Poqueville the Greek women
were extremely ignorant and uneducated;
but, he says, “music and
dancing seem to have been taught
them by nature.” He speaks of the
long flaxen hair of the women of
Sparta, their majestic air and carriage,
their elegant forms, the symmetry of
their features, lighted up by large
blue eyes, fringed and shaded with
long eye-lashes. “The men,” he says,
“among whom some are ‘blonds,’ or
fair, have noble countenances; are of
tall stature, with masculine and regular
features.” They have preserved
something of the Dorians of ancient
Sparta.</p>

<p class='c009'>It would be erroneous, however,
to conclude from this that Greek art
owed everything to the actual. The
type existed more or less imperfectly
in the population, but Phidias and
the Greek artists took and developed
it, by the aid of the imagination, into
that perfect phase of physical beauty
which we justly term the <em>beau-ideal</em>.
A nation’s beau-ideal is always the
perfectionment of its own type. It is
easy to see how this happens. In
nations, as in individuals, the soul
moulds the body, so far as extrinsic
circumstances permit, into a form
in accordance with its own ideas
and desire; and accordingly, whenever
a marked difference exists in the
physical aspect of two nations, there,
also, we may expect to find a variance
in their beau-ideals. Not, as is
generally supposed, from the eye of
each race becoming accustomed to the
national features, but because these
features, are themselves an incarnation
and embodiment of the national mind.
It is the soul which shapes the national
features, not the national features that
mould the æsthetic judgment of the
soul. It is not <em>association</em>, therefore,
that is the cause of the different beau-ideals
we behold in the world, but a
psychical difference in the nations
which produce them,—a circumstance
no more remarkable than those moral
and intellectual diversities in virtue
of which we see one race excelling in
the exact sciences, another in the fine
arts, a third in military renown, and
a fourth in pacific industry. We may
adduce, in curious illustration of this
point, the well-known fact that Raphael
and many other eminent artists
have repeatedly given their own likeness
to the imaginary offspring of their
art,—not real, but idealised likenesses.
How was this? From vanity? No,
certainly; but because the ideal most
congenial to them, which they could
most easily hold in their mind, and
which it gave them most pleasure to
linger over and beautify, was the
ideal constituted by the perfectionment
of their own features. There is something
more than mere vanity in the
pleasure usually derived from looking
into a mirror; for when the features
are in exact or nearly exact accordance
with the desires of the framing
Spirit within, there must always
be a pleasure in the soul looking upon
its own likeness: even as it experiences
a similar delight when meeting
with a being of perfectly congenial nature—in
other words, its spiritual (as
the other is its physical) likeness.
It is to be expected, <i><span lang="la">cæteris paribus</span></i>,
that this pleasure will be most felt by
those who are gifted with much personal
beauty, and whose features are
most perfect of their kind; for in their
case there is more than ordinary harmony
between the soul and its fleshly
envelope. Accordingly, no artist ever
painted himself more than the beautiful
Raphael. And we could name an
eminent individual, now no more, as
rarely gifted with physical beauty as
with mental powers, to whom the
contemplation of his portrait was almost
a passion. Some of our readers
may recognise the distinguished man
of whom we speak. No one less
vain or more noble-hearted than
he, yet his painted likeness had
always a fascination for him. “It
is a curious thing,” he used to say,
“how I like to look at my own portrait.”
Was it not because, in that
beautifully developed form and countenance,
the spirit within had most
successfully embodied its ideal, with
little or no hindrance from extrinsic
circumstances, and accordingly rejoiced,
though it knew not why, in the
presence of its own likeness?</p>

<p class='c009'>But to return to ethnography, and
trace out the successive changes which
have taken place in the population of
Europe. As we have already observed,
the great ebb and flow of nations
was over by the Christian era. The
population had become comparatively
dense, so that room could no more be
made for tribes of new-comers—and
settled in their habits and occupations,
so as no longer to admit of their shifting
or being driven to and fro like
waves over the land, as was the case
while they were in the nomadic state.
And as the nations became consolidated,
they began, however feebly at
first, to live a national existence, and
to put forth national efforts of self-defence
against those who assailed
them. On these various accounts,
the system of conquest by displacement,
which marked the pre-historic
and in a faint degree the early historic
times, was brought to an end,—the
conquests of the Northmen being the
last examples of the kind; and these
being hardly worthy of the name, as
they were marked rather by the political
predominance of the new-comers, and
by an overlaying rather than by any
displacement of the native population.
For all useful purposes, therefore, we
may conceive that at the Christian
era the various nations of Europe were
arranged on the map very much as
they are now,—the only exceptions
worth mentioning being the influx of
the Magyars and Turks, and the
southward progress of several of the
Slavonian tribes through the old Byzantine
provinces into Greece.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Had a Roman geographer of the days
of the Empire,” it has been well observed,
“advanced in a straight line from the Atlantic
to the Pacific, he would have traversed
the exact succession of races that
is to be met in the same route now. First,
he would have found the Celts occupying
as far as the Rhine; thence, eastward to
the Vistula and Carpathian mountains,
he would have found Germans; beyond
them, and stretching away into Central
Asia, he would have found the so-called
Scythians,—a race which, had he possessed
our information, he would have divided
into the two great branches of the
Slavonians or European Scythians, and
the Tartars and Turks, or Asiatic Scythians;
and finally, beyond these, he
would have found Mongolian hordes overspreading
Eastern Asia to the shores of
the Pacific. These successive races or
populations he would have found shading
off into each other at their points of
junction. He would have remarked,
also, a general westward pressure of the
whole mass, tending toward mutual rupture
and invasion,—the Mongolian pressing
against the Tartars, the Tartars against
the Slavonians, the Slavonians against the
Germans, and the Germans against the
Celts.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Although the early history and migrations
of the Slavonians are involved
in greater obscurity than that of either
of the other two great branches of the
European population, it is erroneous
to suppose that they are a recent accession
out of the depths of Asia. It
was evidently a branch of them that
Herodotus describes as peaceful, pastoral,
and agricultural tribes located
near the shores of the Black Sea. Instead
of entering Europe <em>via</em> Asia
Minor and the southern borders of the
Euxine, as many of the Celtic and Teutonic
tribes did, they appear to have
taken the route by the north of the Caspian
and Black Seas, and probably advanced
southwards into Europe on the
gradual and ultimately sudden subsidence
of the waters of the inland sea
which primevally stretched from the
Baltic eastwards to the Sea of Aral.</p>

<p class='c009'>This race, which now constitutes the
largest ethnographical unit of population
in Europe, numbering nearly eighty
millions, has never yet been examined
in rigorous detail. The earliest and
best developed of its tribes is the Polish,
which, though it has in recent
times been subjected by the Russo-Slavons
aided by the German powers,
has not yet lost its nationality; and
it is probable that, in the course of
the future, the mighty Slavonic race
will yet give rise to several distinct
states. Both in features and complexion
there is much diversity to be found
in the various tribes which it comprises;
but, if we consider the immense
numbers of the race, and the
different climes and temperatures under
which they are located, it must
be allowed that they are more homogeneous
in character than any other
people in Europe. The general type
of the Slavonians is thus described by
M. Edwards:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The contour of the head, viewed in
front, approaches nearly to a square; the
height surpasses a little the breadth; the
summit is sensibly flattened; and the direction
of the jaw is horizontal. The
length of the nose is less than the distance
from its base to the chin; it is almost
straight from the depression at its root—that
is to say, without any decided curvature;
but, if appreciable, it is slightly
concave, so that the end has a tendency
to turn up; the lower part is rather large,
and the extremity rounded. The eyes,
which are rather deep-set, are [unlike
those of the Tartars] perfectly on the same
line; and when they have any particular
character, they are smaller than the proportion
of the head ought to indicate.
The eyebrows are thin, and very near the
eyes, particularly at the internal angle;
and from this point are often [like those
of the Tartars] directed obliquely outwards.
The mouth, which is not salient,
has thin lips, and is much nearer to the
nose than to the tip of the chin. Another
singular characteristic may be added, and
which is very general, viz., their small
beard, except on the upper lip [a trait
connecting them with the peoples of Upper
Asia]. Such is the common type
among the Poles, Alesians, Moravians,
Bohemians, Slavonic Hungarians, and is
very common among the Russians.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Having thus briefly and imperfectly
glanced at the ethnographical features
of Europe prior to the Christian era,
we come now to note, equally briefly,
the accession of foreign elements which
the Continent has received subsequently
to that period. The first of these is
the memorable one of the Jews. Unlike
the other incomers, they came not
as conquerors, nor in a mass—but as
isolated exiles, seeking new homes
where they might be suffered to preserve
their religion and gain a livelihood.
A military race when in the
land of their fathers, in Europe they
developed only that other feature of
their nation, the passion for moneymaking.
In pursuit of this object they
have settled in every country of Europe;
and, in spite of persecutions innumerable,
continue to preserve to
this day their religion and their national
features. Despite the warm
passions of the Hebrews, which, even
when in their own land, repeatedly
led both the people and their princes
into the contraction of sexual alliances
with other nations, the Jewish blood on
the whole is still much purer than that
of any other race—the foreign elements
from time to time mingled with it being
gradually thrown off by innumerable
crossings and re-crossings with the
native stock. At present there are
about two millions of Jews in Europe,
and in the rest of the world about a
million and a half. The modern Jews,
while preserving the national features,
present every variety of complexion
save black—for the <em>black</em> Jews of Malabar
are not Jews at all, but the descendants
of apostate Hindoos. In
regard to the matter of complexion,
which varies so much with the climate
and condition of the people, we shall
say something by-and-by; but we
shall here give some remarks of
Mr Leeser, a learned Jew of Philadelphia,
on the curious diversities of
complexion so remarkably observable
among the Hebrew race:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“In respect to the true Jewish complexion,
it is <em>fair</em>; which is proved by the
variety of the people I have seen, from
Persia, Russia, Palestine, and Africa,
not to mention those of Europe and America,
the latter of whom are identical with
the Europeans, like all other white inhabitants
of this continent. All Jews that ever
I have beheld are <em>identical in features</em>;
though the colour of their skin and eyes
differs materially, inasmuch as the Southern
are nearly all black-eyed, and somewhat
sallow, while the Northern are
blue-eyed, in a great measure, and of a
fair and clear complexion. In this they
assimilate to all Caucasians, when transported
for a number of generations into
various climates. Though I am free to
admit that the dark and hazel eye and
tawny skin are oftener met with among
the Germanic Jews than among the German
natives proper. There are also red-haired
and white-haired Jews, as well as
other people, and perhaps of as great a
proportion. I speak now of the Jews
north—I am myself a native of Germany,
and among my own family I know of none
without blue eyes, brown hair (though
mine is black), and very fair skin—still I
recollect, when a boy, seeing many who
had not these characteristics, and had, on
the contrary, eyes, hair, and skin of a
more southern complexion. In America,
you will see all varieties of complexion,
from the very fair Canadian down to the
almost yellow of the West Indian—the
latter, however, is solely the effect of exposure
to a <em>deleterious</em> climate for several
generations, which changes, I should
judge, the texture of the hair and skin,
and thus leaves its mark on the constitution—otherwise
the Caucasian type is
strongly developed; but this is the case
more emphatically among those sprung
from a German than a Portuguese stock.
The latter was an original inhabitant of
the Iberian Peninsula, and whether it
was preserved pure, or became mixed
with Moorish blood in the process of centuries,
or whether the Germans contracted
an intimacy with Teutonic nations,
and thus acquired a part of their national
characteristics, it is impossible to be told
now. But one thing is certain, that, both
in Spain and Germany, conversions to
Judaism during the early ages, say from
the eighth to the thirteenth century, were
by no means rare, or else the governments
would not have so energetically prohibited
Jews from making proselytes of their
servants and others. I know not, indeed,
whether there is any greater physical discrepancy
between northern and southern
Jews than between English families who
continue in England or emigrate to Alabama—I
rather judge there is not.”—<cite>Types
of Mankind</cite>, p. 121.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Huns and Magyars were the
next tribes who made their way into
Europe; and their advent, fierce, rapid,
and exterminating, was conducted
like a charge of cavalry. They
hewed their way with the sword
through the Slavonian and other
tribes who impeded their march; and
after being for a brief season the
terror of Europe, they settled <i><span lang="fr">en permanence</span></i>
on the plains of Hungary,
where for upwards of a thousand
years they dominated, like a ruling
caste, over the surrounding Slavonic
tribes. The influx of this warlike
race took place by two migrations,—firstly,
of the Huns, under Attila,
in the fifth century; and, secondly, of
the Magyars, under Arpad, in the
ninth. The type of the two races was
identical; it is peculiarly exotic, and
unlike any other in Europe. It belongs
to the great Uralian-Tatar
stem of Asia; but, strangely enough,
though they differ in type from
the Fins, the Magyars speak a dialect
of the Finnish language,—which shows
that the two races must have been
associated in some way at a remote
epoch, and before either of them
emerged from the depths of Asia. M.
Edwards thus describes the Magyar
type:—“Head nearly round; forehead
little developed, low, and bending;
the eyes placed obliquely, so that
the external angle is elevated; the
nose short and flat; mouth prominent,
and lips thick; neck very strong, so
that the back of the head appears flat,
forming almost a straight line with
the nape; beard weak and scattering;
stature short.” The Magyars did not
belong to the Caucasian stock; and
their long-continued supremacy over
tribes decidedly Caucasian, is a nut
to crack for those ethnographers who
deduce everything from race, irrespective
of the habits and state of development
of particular nations.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next alien race which entered
Europe was the Gypseys, the history
and peculiarities of which strange
people present many curious analogies
with those of the Israelites. “Both
have had an exodus; both are exiles,
and dispersed among the Gentiles, by
whom they are hated and despised,
and whom they hate and despise under
the names of Busnees and Goyim;
both, though speaking the language
of the Gentiles, possess a peculiar
language which the latter do not understand;
and both possess a peculiar
cast of countenance by which they
may without difficulty be distinguished
from all other nations. But with
these points the similarity terminates.
The Israelites have a peculiar religion,
to which they are fanatically attached;
the Romas (gypseys) have none.
The Israelites have an authentic history;
the Gypseys have no history,—they
do not even know the name of
their original country.” Everything
connected with the Gypsey race is involved
in mystery; though, from their
physical type, language, &#38;c., it is conjectured
that they came from some
part of India. It has been supposed
that they fled from the exterminating
sword of the great Tartar conqueror,
Tamerlane, who ravaged India in
1408–9 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>; but Borrow’s work furnishes
good ground for believing that
they may have migrated at a much
earlier period northwards, amongst
the Slavonians, before they entered
Germany and the other countries
where we first catch sight of them.
All that we know with certainty is,
that in the beginning of the fifteenth
century they appeared in Germany,
and were soon scattered over Europe,
as far as Spain. The precise day upon
which these strange beings first entered
France has been recorded,—namely,
the 17th of August 1427. The entire
number of the race at present is
estimated at about 700,000,—thus
constituting them the smallest as well
as the most singular and distinctly
marked of races. But if their numbers
be small, their range of habitat
is one of the widest. They are scattered
over most countries of the habitable
globe—Europe, Asia, Africa, and
both the Americas, containing specimens
of these roving tribes. “Their
tents,” says Borrow, “are pitched on
the heaths of Brazil and the ridges of
the Himalaya hills; and their language
is heard in Moscow and Madrid, in
London and Stamboul. Their power
of resisting cold is truly wonderful, as
it is not uncommon to find them encamped
in the midst of the snow, in
slight canvass tents, where the temperature
is 25° or 30° below the freezing-point
according to Reaumur;”
while, on the other hand, they withstand
without difficulty the sultry
climes of Africa and India.</p>

<p class='c009'>The last accession which the population
of Europe received was accomplished
by an irruption similar to that
of the Huns, but on a grander scale.
In the beginning of the fifteenth century
the Osmanli Turks swept across
the Hellespont and Bosphorus, and in
1453 established their empire in Europe
by the capture of Byzantium. In
proportion to its numbers, no race
ever gave such a shock to the Western
world as this; and, by its very
antagonism, it helped to quicken into
life the population and kingdoms of
central and eastern Europe. It is
semi-Caucasian by extraction, but,
coming from the northern side of the
Caucasus, and pretty far to the east,
the original features of the race had a
strong dash of the Tartar in them.
The portrait of Mahomed II., the conqueror
of Byzantium, may be taken as
a fair sample of the primitive Turkish
type,—indeed a more than average
specimen, for among all nations the
nobles and princes, as a class, are
ever found to possess the most perfect
forms and features. The Turkish
tribes who still follow their ancient
nomadic life, and wander in the cold
and dry deserts of Turkistan, still exhibit
the Tartar physiognomy—even
the Nogays of the Crimea, and some
of the roving tribes of Asia Minor,
present much of this character. The
European Turks, and the upper classes
of the race generally, exhibit a greatly
superior style of countenance, in
consequence of the elevating influences
of civilisation, and of their
harems having been replenished for
four centuries by fair ones from
Georgia and Circassia,—a region
which, as Chardin long ago remarked,
“is assuredly the one where nature
produces the most beautiful persons,
and a people brave and valiant, as
well as lively, <em>galant</em>, and loving.”
There is hardly a man of quality
in Turkey who is not born of a
Georgian or Circassian mother,—counting
downwards from the Sultan,
who is generally Georgian or Circassian
by the female side. As this
crossing of the two races has been
carried on for several centuries, the
modern Ottomans in Europe are in
truth a <em>new nation</em>—and, on the whole,
a very handsome one. The general
proportion of the face is symmetrical,
and the facial angle nearly vertical,—the
features thus approaching to the
Circassian mould; while the head is
remarkable for its excellent globular
form, with the forehead broad and the
glabella prominent.</p>

<p class='c009'>The natural destiny of the Turks in
Europe, like that of ruling castes everywhere
when holding in subjection a
population greatly more numerous
than themselves, is either to gradually
relax their sway and share the government
with the subject races, as the
Normans in England did,—or, if obstinately
maintaining their class-despotism,
to be violently deposed from the
supremacy. The increasing development
of the Greek and other sections
of the population of European Turkey
has of late years made one or other
of these alternatives imminent; but
the extensive reforms and liberalisation
of the government simultaneously
undertaken by the Ottoman rulers,
and the remarkable abeyance in which
they have begun to place the <em>distinctive</em>
tenets of the Mahommedan
faith, promised, if unthwarted by
foreign influences, to keep the various
races in amity, and admit Christians
to offices in the state. The history
of the last fifteen years has shown this
system of governmental relaxation
growing gradually stronger—so that
Lord Palmerston was justified in saying
that no country in the world could
show so many reforms accomplished
in so short a time as Turkey. And
after the recent exploits of the Ottomans
in defeating simultaneously the
attacks of Russia and of the Greek
and Montenegrin insurgents, and the
Turkish predilections even of those
provinces which were entered by the
Christian forces of the Czar, it cannot
be doubted that the Turkish rule was
on the whole giving satisfaction, and
that, if unaided by foreign Powers,
no insurrection against the supremacy
of the bold-hearted Osmanlis had the
slightest chance of success. It was
this state of matters which alarmed the
ambitious Czar into his present aggression;
for he felt that now or never
was the time to interfere, if he did not
wish to see a Turko-Greek state establish
itself in such strength as to bid
defiance to his power. We may add,
that, whatever be the issue of the present
contest, it must tend to a further
and higher development of the Turkish
character. The contagion of
Western ideas, disseminated in the
most imposing of ways by the presence
of the armies of England and France,
cannot fail to impress itself on the
slumbrous but awakening Ottomans,
and not only expand their stereotyped
civilisation into a wider and freer
form, but possibly to strike also from
their religion the more faulty and
obstructive of its tenets.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such are the elements of the present
population of Europe,—a population
which, in its western and southern
portions, no longer presents distinct
masses of diverse tribes, and
whose various sections every century
is drawing into closer contact. The
progress of commerce and civilisation
produces not only an interchange of
products of various climes, and of
ideas between the various races of
mankind, but also a commingling of
blood; and as the most nobly developed
races are always the great
wanderers and conquerors, it will be
seen that the progress of the world
ever tends to improve the types of
mankind by infusing the blood of the
superior races into the veins of the
inferior. The settlements of the Normans
are an instance of this. And a
still more remarkable, though exceptional,
exemplification of the same
thing may at present be witnessed in
America—where the Negroes, transported
from their native clime, have
already become a mixed race, owing
to the relation in which all female
slaves stand to their masters, and the
consequent frequent crossing of the
European blood with the blood of
Africa. In point of fact, there are
slaves to be found in the Southern
States, who, like “George” in <cite>Uncle
Tom’s Cabin</cite>, are as Caucasian in
their features and intellect as their
masters,—a circumstance fraught with
considerable danger to the White caste
in these States, because producing the
extremest irritation in these nearly
full-blood “white slaves,” and at the
same time providing able and fiery
leaders for the oppressed Negro race
in the event of an insurrection and
servile war.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the great variety of countenance
and temperament in Western
and Southern Europe is not due merely
to actual crossings of the commingling
races. Civilisation itself is the
parent of variety. The progress of
humanity produces physical effects
upon the race, which may be classed
under two heads, one of these being
a general physical improvement, and
the other increasing variety. Take
an undeveloped race like the Tartars
or Negroes, and you will find the
aspect and mental character of the
nation nearly homogeneous,—the differences
existing amongst its individual
members being comparatively
trivial. Pass to the Slavonians, and
you will perceive this uniformity lessened;
and when you reach the nations
of Western Europe, you will
find the transition accomplished, and
homogeneity exchanged for variety.
The explanation of this is obvious.
Just as all plants of the same species,
when in embryo, are nearly alike, undeveloped
races of mankind present
but few signs of spiritual life; and
therefore their individual members
greatly resemble one another,—because
the fewer the characteristics,
the less room is there for variety, and
the more radical and therefore more
universal must be the characteristics
themselves. Pebbles, as they lie
rough upon the sea-shore, may present
a great uniformity of appearance;
but take and polish them, and a hundred
diversities of colour and marking
forthwith show themselves;—even so
does civilisation and growth develop
the rich varieties of human nature.
As these mental varieties spring up
within, they ever seek to develop themselves
by corresponding varieties in
the outer life,—placing men now in
riches, now in poverty, now under the
sway of the intellect, now of the passions,
now of good principles, now of
bad, and moreover leading to an infinite
diversity of external occupation.
The joint influence of the feelings
within, and of the corresponding circumstances
without, in course of time
comes to affect the physical frame,
often in a very marked manner; and,
indeed, it is well known that even so
subtle a thing as the predominant
thoughts and sentiments of an individual
are almost always reflected in
the aspect of his countenance. Nations,
when in a primitive uncultured
state, differ as widely from those at the
apex of civilisation, as the monotonous
countenance and one-phased mind of
a peasant contrasts with the rich variety
of expression in the face of
genius, whose nature is quickly responsive
to every influence, though
often steadied into a masculine calm.
Let any one inspect the various classes
of our metropolitan population, and
he will perceive an amount of physical,
mental, and occupational variety
such as he will meet with nowhere
else in the world—presenting
countenances deformed now by this
form of brutal passion, now by that,
ranging upwards to the noblest types
of the human face, the joint product
of easy circumstances and high mental
and spiritual culture. It is all the
result of civilisation, which ever tends
to break up the uniformity of a population,
and allows of its members rising
to the highest heights or sinking
to the lowest depths,—thus breaking
the primitive monotony of life into its
manifold prismatic hues.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not the least remarkable of the
physical changes thus produced by
civilisation, is the diversity of complexion
which it gradually affects. It
appears certain, for example, that the
races who peopled the northern and
western parts of Europe, subsequent
to the dark-skinned Iberians, were
all of the fair or xanthous style of
complexion; but this is by no means
the case with the great mass of people
who are supposed to have descended
from them. “It seems unquestionable,”
says Prichard, “that the complexion
prevalent through the British
Isles has greatly varied from that of
all [?] the original tribes who are
known to have jointly constituted the
population. We have seen that the
ancient Celtic tribes were a xanthous
race; such, likewise, were the Saxons,
Danes, and Normans; the Caledonians
also, and the Gael, were fair
and yellow-haired. Not so the mixed
descendants of all these blue-eyed
tribes. The Britons had already deviated
from the colour of the Celts in
the time of Strabo, who declares that
the Britons are taller than the Gauls,
and less yellow-haired, and more infirm
and relaxed in their bodies.” The
Germans have also varied in their
complexion. The ancient Germans
are said to have had universally yellow
or red hair and blue eyes,—in
short, a strongly marked xanthous
constitution. This, says Niebuhr,
“has now, in most parts of Germany,
become uncommon. I can assert,
from my own observation, that the
Germans are now, in many parts of
their country, far from a light-haired
race. I have seen a considerable
number of persons assembled in a large
room at Frankfort-on-the-Maine, and
observed that, except one or two
Englishmen, there was not an individual
among them who had not dark
hair. The Chevalier Bunsen has assured
me that he has often looked in
vain for the auburn or golden locks
and the light cerulean eyes of the old
Germans, and never verified the picture
given by the ancients of his
countrymen till he visited Scandinavia,—there
he found himself surrounded
by the Germans of Tacitus.”
In the towns of Germany, especially,
the people are far from being a red-haired,
or even a xanthous race; and,
from the fact that this change has been
developed chiefly in towns, we may
infer that it depends in part on habits,
and the way of living, and on food.
Towns are much warmer and drier
than the country; but even the open
country is much warmer and drier
than the forests and morasses with
which Germany was formerly covered.
The climate of Germany has, in fact,
changed since the country was cleared
of its vast forests; and we must attribute
the altered physical character
of the Germans to the altered condition
under which the present inhabitants
live.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the conquests of Rome that
first scattered the seeds of civilisation
in Western Europe. There it has
grown up into a stately and nearly
perfect fabric on the shores of the
Atlantic, gradually losing its perfection
as it proceeds eastwards, until it
reaches the semi-barbarism of Russia,
and the still deeper barbarism of Upper
Asia. Our limits hardly allow of
our inquiring what influence this civilisation
is calculated to exert in future
upon the ethnological condition of the
Continent, although it is a question of
great importance, as foreshadowing
the chief changes which may be expected
to result from the state of
chronic strife upon which Europe has
now entered. We can only remark
that the grand action of progress and
civilisation is to develop <em>the mind</em>, and
so convert the units of society from a
mass of automatons into thinking and
self-directing agents,—conscious of,
and able to attain, alike their own
rights and those of their nation. Hence
follows the growth of liberty within;
and, without, the gradual establishment
of union between scattered sections
of the same race. Supposing,
then, that the progress of civilisation
in Europe be unobstructed, we may
calculate that wherever we now see
internal despotism, there will be
liberty,—wherever we see foreign domination,
there will be national freedom,—and
that, after a little more
training in the stern school of suffering,
the Continental nations, grown
wiser, will make an end of the present
arbitrary and unnatural territorial system
of Europe, and arrange themselves
in the more natural, grander,
and permanent communities of race.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was doubtless a perception of
this truth that caused the French
Emperor recently to declare that
“the age of conquests is past.” We
regret to think, however, that the
statement is somewhat premature,—for
Europe is still far from that happy
climax of civilisation which in the
preceding sentences we have indicated.
Moreover, there are two very
opposite periods in the life of nations
when the race-principle reigns supreme,
their first and their last;—just
as, in the case of individuals, men
often adopt in old age, from the dictates
of experience, principles which
in youth they had acted upon from
instinct. Now, Europe at this day
presents both of these phases of national
life existing simultaneously,
at its eastern and western extremities;
and it seems probable that the development
of the race-principle in its
early form among the Slavonians,
will take precedence of its development
in maturity among the civilised
races of the Continent. There is
every indication that the Panslavism
of Russia will precede the coalescing
of the Teutonic tribes into a united
Germany—or of the Romano-Gallic
races of France, Spain, and Italy,
into that trinity of confederate states
which Lamartine so stoutly predicts.
Nay, may not this Panslavism of
Russia, by a short-lived political domination,
be destined to prove the
very means of exciting the ethnological
affinities of the rest of Europe, and
of thereby raising up an insuperable
barrier to its own progress, as well as
involuntarily launching the other nations
on their true line of progress?</p>

<p class='c009'>The fag-end of an article is little
suitable for the discussion of such
really momentous topics, and we especially
regret that we cannot proceed
to consider the effects which the progress
of civilisation is likely to exert
upon Russia itself. Any one, however,
who is disposed to supply for
himself the deductions from the above
principles, will feel that his labour in
so doing is not without its recompense,
by establishing the consolatory truth
that, so far as human eye can discern,
“a good time coming” is yet
in store for Europe,—though, alas,
what turmoil must there be between
this and then!</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>THE GANGETIC PROVINCES OF BRITISH INDIA.<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c007'><sup>[35]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Disguise it as we may, conquest
to the conquered must ever be a bitter
draught.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is impossible for nations to be
entirely disinterested. The rewards
of the victors cannot be reaped without
trenching upon the rights of the
vanquished.</p>

<p class='c009'>Three centuries have gone by since
Machiavelli wrote, yet still does the
Italian mutter his words, “<span lang="it">Ad ognuno
puzza questo barbaro dominio;</span>” and
all the material benefits which the
peasantry of Lombardy often admit
that they enjoy under their present
masters, cannot abate the aversion of
the people of that province to the
Austrian rule.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are more points of resemblance
than we may like to confess
between the position of Austria towards
Italy, and that of England towards
India. In both cases, the
bulk of the conquered, especially the
agricultural classes, have little to
complain of, and are on the whole
passively contented and reconciled to
a yoke which, as far as they are concerned,
presses, perhaps, but does not
gall; in both cases, all of a higher
order, all upon whom ambition can
have any influence, must feel more or
less discontented with a condition
necessarily attended with a diminished
chance of advancement, and a mortifying
stagnation of hope. Both of
the dominant powers ought to regard
this frame of mind not as a fault, but
as a moral malady, and to direct
their best efforts to the cure of an
affection naturally resulting from the
depressed position of those brought
by conquest under their sway.</p>

<p class='c009'>What the sanative measures of
Austria may have been, and into the
causes of their failure, we need not
stop to inquire, but may proceed at
once to consider in how far we have,
in this respect, acquitted ourselves of
our obligations to those over whom
we also rule mainly by the right of
conquest and superior strength.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not being gifted, like many of our
contemporaries, with power to take in
the totality of the gorgeous East at
one comprehensive glance, we must
examine our Indian empire in detail,
and for the present confine our remarks
to the Presidency of Bengal,
with its appendage the Lieutenant-Governorship
of Agra.</p>

<p class='c009'>The guides whom we propose to
follow in the prosecution of our inquiries
into the state of these Gangetic
provinces, their past and present
condition, and their future prospects,
are the authors enumerated at the
foot of the page, each of whom
may be regarded as a representative
of one or other of the schools into
which those interested in the work of
Indian administration may now be
said to be divided.</p>

<p class='c009'>The history of our civil administration
of the Gangetic portion of our
Eastern territory divides itself into
three distinct periods. The first, extending
from the victories of Clive in
1757, to the commencement of Lord
Cornwallis’s system in 1793, may be
called the heroic and irregular; the
second, dating from the year last mentioned,
and continuing till the accession
of Lord William Bentinck in
1829, may be designated the judicial
and regular; and the third, stretching
from that time to the present day, the
anti-judicial and progressive period.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the first of these periods, it
is in vain to deny that gross abuses
prevailed, and that many acts of oppression
were committed by those
very individuals among our own
countrymen, whose heroism in the field
and sagacity in council were the subjects
of admiration to such natives as
were brought into communication and
contact with them.</p>

<p class='c009'>A degree of intimacy thus subsisted
between the European rulers and
natives of higher rank, such as, in
these days, is only to be found where
the native has been by education assimilated
in some degree to the Englishman.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is stated by Mr F. H. Robinson,
that men who had left India at that
early period, could not believe those
who, in after years, told them of the
social estrangement prevailing in that
country, and of the reluctance evinced,
even by Mahommedans, to share a
repast with a Christian.</p>

<p class='c009'>Engaged, as the English of those
early days were, in a struggle for political
existence, their deportment towards
natives of rank was influenced by the
often-felt necessity of winning them
over to their interests; and thus our
national disposition to be contemptuously
churlish towards those who
differ from ourselves in language,
complexion, and manner, was kept for
a while in abeyance. At that period,
therefore, we find traces of friendly
personal feeling subsisting between
Englishmen and natives, and expressed
by the latter, even in the same
breath with the most earnest protestations
against the mal-administration
of the country then in our hands.
Striking instances of these conflicting
feelings are exhibited in that most
curious work entitled <cite>Syar-ul Mootekherin</cite>,
which may be translated
into a “Review of Modern Times,”
or more literally, “Manners of the
Moderns.” This history of the events
attending the downfall of the Moghul
and the rise of our own power in
India, was written by a Mahommedan
gentleman, of the name of Mir
Gholan Hussein, whose descendants,
if we are not misinformed, continued
under our rule to hold possession of
certain lands in the province of Behar,
since lost to them in a manner likely
to be chronicled among the events of
the third of the three historic periods
to which we have alluded.</p>

<p class='c009'>If even at this distance of time it
is painful to read the reproaches bestowed
by the author on our internal
administration, it is still consolatory
to find one, to whom neither partiality
nor flattery can be imputed, recording
his unfeigned admiration of the personal
conduct of many of our countrymen
in those early days.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of Warren Hastings the author
writes with enthusiasm. He records
all of that great man’s troubles with
his council; and gives, if we remember
right—for we have not been able to
find a complete translation of the
work in London—a circumstantial
account of the duel with Francis,
fought, according to English custom,
with <em>tummunchas</em> (pistols), in a
<em>bugishea</em> (garden); and then after
narrating the complete dispersion of
the factious opposition by which he
had been thwarted, he breaks out in a
triumphant tone, with an exclamation
like the following: “Now did the
genius of Mr Hastings, like the sun
bursting through a cloud, beam forth
in all its splendour.” In describing
an action fought in the vicinity of the
city of Patna, in the year 1760, the
native author dwells with delight upon
the conduct of his friend Dr William
Fullerton, who, in the midst of a retreat
in the face of a victorious enemy,
on an ammunition-cart breaking down,
stopped unconcernedly, put it in order,
and then bravely pursued his route,
and “it must be acknowledged,” he
adds, “that this nation’s presence of
mind, firmness of temper, and undaunted
bravery, are past all question.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In abatement of these praises, he
adds the following reflections: “If, to
so many military qualifications, they
knew how to join the art of government,
no nation would be preferable
to them, or prove worthier of command;
but such is their little regard
to the people of these kingdoms, and
such their apathy and indifference for
their welfare, that the people under
their dominion groan everywhere, and
are reduced to poverty and distress.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Though this censure is in so far
unfair, that all is, in Oriental fashion,
imputed to the ruling power, without
allowance for the circumstances of a
period of troublous transition, it is
evidently penned in an honest and
friendly spirit; and evinces no repugnance
whatever to the domination of
the English, provided they would
acquire some better knowledge of
“the art of government.” In another
passage he recounts how gallantly a
Hindoo of high rank, Rajah Shitab
Roy, co-operated with Captain Knox
in attacking an immensely superior
force, and how heartily, on returning
to Patna, the English captain expressed
his admiration of his Hindoo ally,
exclaiming repeatedly, “This is a real
Nawab; I never saw such a Nawab in
my life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon afterwards the French officer
with the force opposed to the English,
the Chevalier Law, having been deserted
by his men, remained by himself
on the field of battle, when, bestriding
one of his guns, “he awaited
the moment of his death.” His surrender
and courteous reception are
dwelt on with evident delight; and,
after stating how a rude question addressed
to the Chevalier by a native
chief was checked and rebuked by the
English officer, he makes the following
observation:—“This reprimand
did much honour to the English; and
it must be acknowledged, to the honour
of these strangers, that as their
conduct in war and in battle is worthy
of admiration, so, on the other hand,
nothing is more modest and more becoming
than their behaviour to an
enemy, whether in the heat of action
or in the pride of success and victory.”</p>

<p class='c009'>These extracts, borrowed from the
notes to the third volume of Mill’s
History, might be supported by many
other passages of a similar tendency
in the native work itself; and all tend
to prove that the social estrangement
since prevailing between our countrymen
and the native gentry has not
had its origin in the religious scruples
of the latter, or in any decided aversion
on their part to a closer intercourse
with the strangers to whom
Providence has assigned the mastery
over their land.</p>

<p class='c009'>This view is confirmed, in as far as
the Mahommedans are concerned, by
what Mrs Colin Mackenzie tells us of
the comments of the Afghan chiefs on
the reluctance of their co-religionists
in Hindostan to share a repast with
their Christian rulers, and the absence
of any fellowship between the two
classes is traced by that lady to the
very cause to which it is in our opinion
also mainly to be ascribed;
namely, to our peculiar and somewhat
repulsive bearing towards all
who differ from ourselves in tone of
thought, in taste, or in manners.—With
a scrupulous respect for the
persons and property of those among
whom we are thrown by the accidents
of war, or trade, or travel, we too
often manifest a great disregard for
the feelings; and as insults rankle in
the memory long after injuries are
forgotten, we find that liberal expenditure
and strict justice in our dealings
cannot make us as popular as our
rivals the French, even in countries
where we paid for all, and they for
nothing, that was supplied or taken.
Now, it is well remarked by Mr
Marshman, at p. 63 of his Reply to
Mr Cobden, that “everything in and
about our Eastern Empire is English,
even to our imperfections;” and
among them we need not be surprised
to find an undue scorn of all
that is foreign, heightened by the
arrogance of conquest and the Anglo-Saxon
antipathy to a dark complexion.
This last is a more potent
principle than in our present humour
of theoretical philanthropy we may
be disposed to admit; but it seems to
be born with us, for it may be seen
sometimes in English children at an
age too young for prejudice, or even a
perception of social distinctions.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was said by “the Duke,” that
there is no aristocracy like the aristocracy
of colour; and all experience in
lands where the races are brought into
contact, proves the correctness of the
aphorism.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the first thirty years of our
ascendancy in India, this most forbidding
of our national characteristics
was kept in check by the exigencies of
our position; and the consequence was,
that, notwithstanding all the corruption
of the time, we were then individually
more popular than we have
ever been since. There was so little
of what could be called European
society then to be met with throughout
the country, that Englishmen were
drawn into some degree of intimacy
with natives, in order to escape from
the painful sense of total isolation and
solitude. That this intercourse was
favourable to morality in the highest
sense of the term, is more than we
can venture to affirm; each party too
often acquired more of the faults than
of the virtues of the other. But still,
bad as the public and private life of
Anglo-Indians was at that period,
and however great the corruption that
prevailed, these defects in those who
ruled were perhaps more tolerable to
the governed than the ill-mannered
integrity of a succeeding generation.</p>

<p class='c009'>The abuses had probably gone on
increasing, and the palliating courtesy
most likely diminishing, when a
new era was ushered in by the arrival
of the first Governor-General of superior
rank, in the person of the Marquis
Cornwallis.</p>

<p class='c009'>We must refer our readers to Mr
Kaye’s pages for a clear description
of the state of the Bengal Presidency
at the commencement of this
the second of the three periods into
which we have assumed that its history
may be distributed. Our space
will not allow of our entering into the
controversy about the merits of the
system then introduced by Lord Cornwallis
and his coadjutors, but we
gladly make room for the following
picture of the state of the peasantry
in Bengal, sketched as we are assured
by an eyewitness, in the course of
the year 1853.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What strikes the eye most in any
village, or set of villages, in a Bengal
district, is the exuberant fertility of the
soil, the sluttish plenty surrounding the
Grihasta’s (cultivator’s) abode, the rich
foliage, the fruit and timber trees, and the
palpable evidence against anything like
penury. Did any man ever go through a
Bengalee village and find himself assailed
by the cry of want or famine? Was he
ever told that the Ryot and his family
did not know where to turn for a meal,
that they had no shade to shelter them,
no tank to bathe in, no employment for
their active limbs? That villages are
not neatly laid out like a model village
in an English county; that things seem to
go on, year by year, in the same slovenly
fashion; that there are no local improvements,
and no advances in civilisation, is
all very true. But considering the wretched
condition of some of the Irish peasantry,
or even the Scotch, and the
misery experienced by hundreds in the
purlieus of our great cities at home, compared
with the condition of the Ryots
who know neither cold nor hunger, it is
high time that the outcry about the extreme
unhappiness of the Bengal Ryot
should cease.”—(P. 194.)</p>

<p class='c008'>It is cheering to read in the chapter
of Mr Kaye’s work, from which the
above extract is taken, the proofs that
the labours of Cornwallis and his able
coadjutors have not been fruitless, and
that the peasantry of the part of India
more immediately under their care,
are not, as some have asserted, to
this hour suffering from their blundering
humanity.</p>

<p class='c009'>It would indeed be most mortifying
to think that regulations, pronounced
at the time of their promulgation by
Sir Wm. Jones and the best English
lawyers in India (though, in the true
spirit of professional pedantry, they
would not allow them to be called
laws), to be such as would do credit
to any legislator of ancient or modern
times, should really in operation have
proved productive of little or no good.</p>

<p class='c009'>The preambles to some of the first
of these regulations are worthy of
notice, even on the score of literary
merit; and it is impossible to peruse
them without feeling that they must
have proceeded from highly cultivated
minds, deeply impressed with the importance
of the duty on which they
were engaged.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the recorded opinion of the
late Mr Courtenay Smith, of the Bengal
Civil Service (a brother of the
celebrated Sidney Smith, and, like
him, a man of great wit and general
talent, though unfortunately his good
things were mostly expressed in Persian
or Hindostanee, and are thus
lost to the European world), that
succeeding governments have always
erred as they have departed from the
principles of the Cornwallis code; and
that it would have been well if they
had confined their legislation to such
few modifications of the regulations
of 1793 as the slowly progressive
changes of Oriental life might have
really rendered necessary.</p>

<p class='c009'>For very nearly thirty years the
government of Bengal resisted the
tempting facility of legislation incident
to its position of entire and absolute
power, and was content to rule
upon the principles, and in general
adherence to the forms, prescribed by
those early enactments.</p>

<p class='c009'>The benefits resulting from this
system were to be seen in a yearly
extending cultivation, a growing respect
for rights of property, and the
gradual rise in the minds of the people
of an habitual reference to certain
known laws, instead of to the caprice
of a ruler, for their guidance in the
more serious affairs of life.</p>

<p class='c009'>The counterbalancing evils alleged
against it were, the monopoly of all
high offices by the covenanted servants
of the East India Company;
the accumulation of suits in the courts
of civil justice—a result partly of that
monopoly, and partly of the check
imposed by our police on all simpler
and ruder modes of arbitrement;
and its tendency, by humouring the
Asiatic aversion to change, to keep
things stationary, and discountenance
that progress without which there
ought, in the opinion of many of our
countrymen, to be no content on earth.
Indeed, the very fact of the natives of
Bengal being satisfied with such a
system, would, we apprehend, be advanced
as a reason for its abolition—a
contented frame of mind, under their
circumstances, being held to indicate
a moral abasement, only to be corrected
by the excitement of a little
discontent. But, in truth, there was
nothing in the Cornwallis system to
preclude the introduction of necessary
amendments.</p>

<p class='c009'>The great reproach attaching to it
was the insufficient employment of
natives, and the exclusive occupation
by the Civil Service of the higher judicial
posts. Now, we hope to make it
clear, by a brief explanation, that the
correction of both of these evils might
more easily have been effected under
the Cornwallis system, than under
that by which it has been superseded.
There are, as we have remarked at
the outset of this article, questions of
difficult solution inseparable from
conquest; among which, that of the
degree of trust to be reposed in the
conquered is perhaps the greatest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Where attachment can hardly be
presumed to exist, some reserve in
the allotment of power appears to be
dictated by prudence; and to fix the
amount of influence annexed to an
office to be filled by one of the subjugated,
so as to render its importance
and respectability compatible with
the supremacy of the ruling race, is
far from being so easy as those imagine
who, in their reliance on certain
general principles of supposed
universal application, leave national
feelings and prejudices out of account
in making up their own little nostrums
for the improvement of mankind.</p>

<p class='c009'>Under the Cornwallis system, there
was an office which, though then always
filled by a member of the Civil Service,
seemed, in the limitation as well as the
importance of its duties, to be exactly
suited for natives to hold. When the
civil file of a district became overloaded
with arrears, the government used
to appoint an officer to be assistant or
deputy judge. To him the regular
judge of the district was empowered
to refer any cases that he thought fit,
though there his power ceased, as the
appeal lay direct to the provincial
court from the award of the deputy.</p>

<p class='c009'>The deputy being made merely a
referee without original jurisdiction,
was a wise provision for keeping the
primary judicial power in the hands
of the officer charged with the preservation
of the peace of the district,
while importance and weight were
given to the office of the deputy, by
making the appeals from his decisions
lie to the Provincial Court, and not
to his local superior. A single little
law of three lines, declaring natives of
India to be eligible to the office of
Deputy Judge, would, by throwing a
number of respectable situations open
to their aspirations, have provided
for their advancement, without any
disturbance of institutions to which
the people of the country had become
accustomed and reconciled. Again,
as to the monopoly of higher judicial
office by members of the Civil Service,
the Cornwallis system, perhaps, provided
a readier means of abating even
this grievance than will be found in
that by which it has been supplanted.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nothing can be more extravagant
than the scheme of sending out barristers
from Westminster Hall, to
undertake, without any intermediate
training, the management of districts
in Bengal and Hindostan. Sir William
Jones himself, unintelligible as
he was, on his first arrival, to the
natives of India, would have failed
if he had undertaken such a task.
This visionary proposal has happily
received its <em>coup de grace</em> from Sir
Edward Ryan, the late Chief Justice
in Bengal, in his evidence before the
Commons’ Committee; but it does not,
in our opinion, follow that the aid of
lawyers trained in England is therefore
to be altogether discarded in providing
for the administration of justice
in India. Although the man fresh from
England would be sadly bewildered if
left by himself in a separate district,
it does not follow that he should not,
after some preparatory training, be
able to co-operate vigorously with
others. The horse will go well in
double-harness, or in a team, who
would upset a gig, and kick it to
pieces.</p>

<p class='c009'>If barristers chose to repair to
Bengal, and, while there practising at
the bar of the Supreme Court, would
study the native languages, it appears
to us that, on their proficiency being
proved by an examination, they might
have been advantageously admitted,
under certain limitations as to number,
into the now abolished Provincial
Courts.</p>

<p class='c009'>Had these experimental provisions
in favour of natives of India, and
barristers from England, been found
to succeed, their eligibility to every
grade in the judicial branch of the
service might have been proclaimed,
and the most plausible of all the complaints
against our system of Indian
government would thus have been
removed. But improvement without
change was not to the taste of those
by whom the last of our three administrative
periods was ushered in; and
in further confirmation of Mr Marshman’s
remark, already cited, on the
parallelism of movement in England
and in India, it was in the changeful
years 1830 and 1831 that a revolution
was effected in our system of internal
administration, which has since given
a colour and a bent to our whole
policy in the East. In the course of
those two years the magisterial power
was detached from the office of the
judge, and annexed to that of the
collector; the Provincial Courts were
abolished, their judicial duties being
transferred to the district judges, and
their ministerial functions of superintendence
and control to commissioners,
each with the police and revenue
of about half a dozen districts under
his charge.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two Sudder, or courts of ultimate
resort, were established, one at Calcutta,
the other at Allahabad in upper
India; but all real executive power
centred in the magisterial revenue
department, presided over by two
Boards, located, like the Sudder
Courts, at Calcutta and Allahabad.</p>

<p class='c009'>One of the new provisions then introduced
abolished the office of Register,
or subordinate Judge, held by
young civilians conjointly with that
of Assistant to the Magistrate. This
was a most serious change, for it
abolished the very situation in which
young civilians received their judicial
training, and fitted themselves for the
better eventual discharge of the higher
duties of the judicature.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Registers used to have the
trial of civil suits for property, if not
more than five hundred rupees (£50)
in value. The abolitionists urged the
injustice of letting raw youths experimentalise
upon small suits, to the supposed
detriment of poor suitors. There
was a show of reason in this mode of
arguing; but those who used it did not
give due weight to the consideration
that these youths were to become the
dispensers of justice to all classes, and
that it was better for the country to
suffer a little from their blunders at
the outset, than to have them at last
advanced to the highest posts on the
judgment-seat without any judicial
training whatsoever. But, in fact, the
whole argument was based upon a
mere assumption. The young Registers
certainly committed occasional
blunders, as old Justices and Aldermen,
if we are to believe the daily
papers, constantly commit them in
England; but, on the whole, their
courts were generally popular and in
good repute among the natives. The
young civilian had often a pride in his
own little court of record, liked to
know that it was well thought of, and
was sometimes pleased to find parties
shaping their plaints so as to bring
them within the limits of his cognisance.</p>

<p class='c009'>They thus often acquired a personal
regard for the people, whom it
was their pride, as well as their duty,
to protect—a feeling which has since,
we fear, been too much weakened.
The young civilians of the present day,
though excellent men of business, and
accomplished linguists, have seldom
any individual feeling for the natives,
whom they regard in a light for which
no word occurs to us so happily expressive
as the French term, “les
administrés.” Thus it happened that
the abolition of Registerships proved
almost the death-blow to the Cornwallis
system, and shook, not merely
the framework, but the very principles
of judicial administration throughout
the country. It was followed up
by a series of measures, all calculated
to lower the judicial department of the
service, and to prove to the natives
that the protection of the law, promised
in the still unrepealed regulations,
was thenceforward to prove
illusory, wherever it was required to
shield them from the encroachments
of any new scheme or theory finding
favour for the moment with an executive
government ruling avowedly
upon principles of expediency, and
seeking every occasion to shake off
the trammels imposed upon its freedom
of action by the cautious provisions
of the Cornwallis code.</p>

<p class='c009'>The people soon found in their
rulers under the new system a scrupulous
discharge of all positive duties,
combined with a diminished consideration
for native prejudices, a neglect of
many punctilios of etiquette, and a
stern hostility to every exceptional
privilege exempting an individual in
any degree from the operation of the
rules of general administration. This
last-mentioned tendency showed itself
particularly in the case of the
rent-free tenures, which had for some
ten years previously been undergoing
revision.</p>

<p class='c009'>These landed tenures were held
under grants from former rulers, exempting
the grantee and his heirs
from all payment on the score of revenue,
though sometimes, as in our
own feudal tenures, imposing upon
him obligations of suit and service in
some form or other.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the framers of the Cornwallis
code, in 1793, determined on
recognising the validity of every such
tenure as was held under an authentic
and sufficient grant, a provision was
at the same time made for their
being carefully recorded and registered.</p>

<p class='c009'>This duty of registration was, however,
either totally neglected or very
imperfectly performed, and the consequence
was, that by collusive extensions
of their limits, and other
means, such as it would be tedious to
explain, the rent-free tenures were
gradually eating into the rent-paying
lands forming the main source of the
revenues of the state. Careful revision,
therefore, became necessary, and
was in fact commenced so far back as
the year 1819. The inquiry was intrusted
to the officers of the revenue
department; but for some time permission
was left to those discontented
with their award, to bring the question
at issue between them and the
Government before the regular courts
of justice for final decision. This process
proving too tardy, in about ten
years afterwards a sort of exchequer
court, called a Special Commission,
was erected for the trial of appeals
from the decisions of the revenue
authorities on the validity of rent-free
grants. This commission was filled
by officers of the judicial branch of the
service, and their proceedings, carried
on in strict conformity with the practice
of the courts of civil justice, gave
no offence, and created no alarm, notwithstanding
that extensive tracts
were brought by their decisions under
the liability of paying revenue to the
state. But not long after the country
had entered into the third period of
its administration, the revenue authorities
got impatient of all restraint,
and sought to break through the impediments
of judicial procedure and
rules. The primary proceedings, being
intrusted to young deputy-collectors,
were carried on with a rapidity
which rendered due investigation
utterly impossible, and all real inquiry
must have been deemed superfluous
by juniors, who saw their
superiors gravely pronounce, even in
official documents, that the very existence
of a rent-free tenure was an
abuse, and ought to be abated.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have said that the forgeries
practised by some, and the extension
of their privileges by others of the
holders, rendered strict investigation of
rent-free tenures an immediate necessity
and a duty. Still, it was to be
borne in mind, that our faith was
pledged to the recognition of all <em>genuine</em>
grants, and that, in the larger of
these tenures, the fallen nobility and
gentry of the land found their solace
for the loss of power, place, station,
hope of advancement, and all that
gives a zest to the life of the upper
classes in every part of the globe;
while the smaller tenures of the kind
constituted, in many instances, the
sole support of well-descended but
indigent families. There was something
to move the compassion even
of a universal philanthropist, in the
thought of the humble individuals of
both sexes to whom a sweeping resumption
of all such tenures was in
fact the extinction of almost every
earthly hope. The Indian government
itself, though at that period
described by Mr F. H. Robinson
(p. 12) as “a despotism administered
upon radical principles,” became
startled at the havoc which the zeal
of its subordinates was committing
among this class of sufferers, and interfered
to mitigate the severity of
their proceedings. Many of the “soft-hearted”
seniors of the Civil Service
rejoiced at a resolution which relieved
them from an odious and painful duty.
But thus reasons a strong-minded
junior on what he regards as a feeble
concession:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Unfortunately the long delay in making
the investigations had established in
their seats the fraudulent appropriators
of the revenue; and when it came to be
taken from them, the measure caused
great change and apparent hardship to
individuals in comfortable circumstances;
hence arose a great cry of hardship and
injustice. We were still most apt to view
with sympathy the misfortunes of the
higher classes; many soft-hearted officers
of Government exclaimed against the
sudden deprivation; and some of the
seditious Europeans, who find their profit
in professional attacks on Government,
raised the cry much louder. But the
worst of the storm had expended itself;
a little firmness, a little voluntary beneficence
to individual cases, and it would
have ceased; and the temporary inconvenience
to fraudulent individuals would
have resulted in great permanent addition
to the means of the state; but the
Bengal Government is pusillanimous.
Since Warren Hastings was persecuted
in doing his duty, and Lord Cornwallis
praised for sacrificing the interests of
Government, and of the body of the people,
it has always erred on the side of
abandoning its rights to any sufficiently
strong interested cry. It wavered about
these resumptions. It let off first one
kind of holding, then another, then all
holdings under one hundred beegas (about
seventy acres), whether one man possessed
several such or not: life-tenures were
granted where no right existed. Finally,
<em>all</em> resumed lands were settled at <em>half</em>
rates in perpetuity, and the Board of
Revenue intimated that they ‘would be
happy to see all operations discontinued.’
The result therefore is, that the Government
have incurred all the odium and
abuse of the measure, have given the cry
more colour by so much yielding, and in
the end have got not half so much revenue
as they ought to have had. There
has been an addition of about £300,000
to the annual revenue, at an expense of
£800,000.”<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c007'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>According to Mr Campbell’s calculation,
a stricter enforcement of the
resumption laws might have doubled
the above sum; but as only the
smaller tenures were let off, it is
scarcely possible that more than half
as much again as was actually realised
could have been wrung out of the
remnants to which the Government
so timidly, as he asserts, abandoned
its rights. An addition, therefore,
of about £450,000 to our annual
income would have been all
that we should have gained by a
measure violating the most solemn
pledge given to the people that every
<span class='fss'>VALID</span> grant should be respected, reducing
many families to ruin, and
shaking the general confidence in our
honesty and good faith. Though the
passage cited is open to many objections
on the score of arbitrary assumption
and false reasoning, it is to its
hardness of tone that we would chiefly
draw our readers’ attention, as strongly
confirmatory of the following remark,
taken from Mr F. H. Robinson’s
pamphlet:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have said enough, I think, to demonstrate
that the disaffection which exists
is traceable to the despotic character
our administration has of late years
assumed, simultaneously with its sedulous
diffusion of liberal doctrines; to the
unhappy dislike of natives, as natives,
which has crept in among the servants of
Government; to the many acts of abuse,
oppression, and arbitrary misgovernment,
arising as much from misguided zeal as
from evil intention, which, on the part of
the administrative officers, harass and
vex the people.”—(P. 31).</p>

<p class='c008'>We have already recorded our assent
to Mr Marshman’s remark on the thoroughly
English character of our Indian
empire and its administration;
but we have, moreover, to observe,
that, in the application of new principles
even of European growth, India
often outstrips the mother country.
That which in England is still theory
has in India become practice. There
are not wanting in England people to
maintain that all grants of olden times
ought to be forfeited, and their proceeds
applied to the purposes of general
government. If these people had
their way, they would certainly resume
the lands of the deans and chapters,
probably those of the schools and
colleges, and possibly such also as
are devoted to the support of almshouses,
and other charitable institutions
scattered over the face of the
country. These speculations in England
evaporate in pamphlets, and cannot
for a long time assume any more
positive form than that of a speech in
the House of Commons. But the
following passage in Mr F. H. Robinson’s
pamphlet shows us how differently
such matters are ordered in India:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Government have systematically
resumed, of late years, all religious endowments;
an extensive inquiry has been
going on into all endowments, grants,
and pensions; and in almost every one
in which the continuance of religious endowments
has been recommended by subordinate
revenue authorities, backed by
the Board of Revenue, the fiat of confiscation
has been issued by the Government.”—(P. 17).</p>

<p class='c008'>Again, there are many in England
who would gladly reduce the landed
possessions of great proprietors, like
the Duke of Buccleuch and others, to
more moderate dimensions; but they
hardly venture to put forth speculations
upon a measure which, in India,
has been carried into positive and extensive
execution.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fourth chapter of Mr Kaye’s
work contains a clear and admirable
account of the recent settlement of the
provinces of the Upper Ganges, in the
course of which the reader will meet
with the following passage:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“There was a class of large landed
proprietors, known as Talookdars, the
territorial aristocracy of the country.
The settlement officers seem to have
treated these men as usurpers and monopolists,
and to have sought every opportunity
of reducing their tenures. It was
not denied that such reduction was, on
the whole, desirable, inasmuch as these
large tenures interfered with the rights
of the village proprietors. But the reduction
was undertaken in too precipitate
and arbitrary a manner; and the Court
of Directors acknowledged that it had
caused great practical embarrassment to
Government, against whom numerous
suits were instituted in the civil courts
by the ousted talookdars, and many decided
in their favour.”—(P. 265).</p>

<p class='c008'>The redress afforded by these decisions
of the civil courts has not, we
fear, been sufficient to avert the ruin
of such members of the “territorial
aristocracy” as had the hardihood to
withhold their adhesion to a scheme
for their own extinction. The principle
of that scheme was to grant, in
the form of a per-centage on the revenue
realised from the village communities
of what had been his domain, a
pension to the talookdar who was
willing, for such a consideration, to
give up all the other advantages of
his hereditary position. Many of
these men, or their immediate predecessors,
had rendered us great service
in the war by which we acquired the
country; but they stood in the way
of a favourite scheme, and before its
irresistible advance they were compelled
to retire. The provision made
for their future wants may have been
a liberal one; but how would the
Duke of Buccleuch or the Marquess of
Westminster like to be thus pensioned
off?</p>

<p class='c009'>The truth had better be frankly
avowed; the object aimed at is, to get
rid of the old territorial aristocracy
altogether,—indeed, it is so stated by
Mr Campbell in the following sentences:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is, I think, a remarkable distinction
between the manners of the natives
and ours, and one which much affects our
dealings with them, that there does not
exist that difference of tone between the
higher and lower classes—the distinction,
in fact, of a gentleman. The lower classes
are to the full as good and intelligent as
with us; indeed, they are much more
versed in the affairs of life, plead their
causes better, make more intelligent witnesses,
and have many virtues.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But these good qualities are not in
the same proportion in the higher classes;
they cannot bear prosperity; it causes
them to degenerate, especially if they
are born to greatness. The only efficient
men of rank (with, of course, a few exceptions)
are those who have risen to
greatness. The lowest of the people, if
fate raise him to be an emperor, makes
himself quite at home in his new situation,
and shows an aptitude of manner and
conduct unknown to Europeans similarly
situated; but his son is altogether degenerate.
Hence the impossibility of adapting
to anything useful most of the higher
classes found by us, and for all fresh requirements
it is necessary to <em>create</em> a fresh
class. From the acuteness and aptness
to learn of the inferior classes, this can
be done as is done in other countries.”—(Pp.
63, 64).</p>

<p class='c008'>We fully subscribe to all that is
here said in commendation of the
lower classes of our Indian subjects,
but we demur to the author’s very
disparaging estimate of the capacity
of the higher orders. Doubtless there
are, or rather were, many dull men of
rank on the banks of the Ganges; but
are there none on those of the Thames?—no
squires of cramped and confused
notions, no fortunate inheritors of
wealth content to wallow through
life in utter disregard of the duties
attaching to property, while fiercely
jealous of its rights? It would be a
sad day for our own landed aristocracy
if Mr Campbell were to obtain sway in
England, and try to rule that country
upon the principles of which he approves
in the East. But if he could,
would our peasantry be <em>permanently</em>
bettered by a change tending towards
a destruction of all the gradations of
society? If the reply to this query
should be in the affirmative, we may
contemplate with unalloyed satisfaction
the progress of a system the description
and defence of which is the
main object of Mr Campbell’s work;
but if we feel any hesitation as to the
future effects of such a change in
England, then, human nature being
much the same in every clime, we
ought to have some misgivings as to
its eventual results in the East. We
say <em>eventual</em>, because the <em>immediate</em>
fruits of the measures described by
Mr Campbell have, we are assured
by him, and have heard from other
quarters, been satisfactory and cheering.
But is it probable that a whole
nation should rest satisfied for ever in
this state of flat and tame sufficiency?
and can we wonder to find alongside
of Mr Campbell’s picture of what
ought to be the feelings towards the
English of the present day on the
banks of the Ganges, Mr F. H.
Robinson’s gloomy account of what,
in his opinion, those feelings really
are? Having been compelled, as a
member of the Board of Revenue, to
make a communication to an old
retired officer of Gardiner’s Irregular
Horse, and to a Mussulman of rank,
calculated to hurt the feelings of both,
Mr Robinson thus describes what
followed:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall never forget the looks of mortification,
anger, and at first of incredulity,
with which this announcement was
received by both, nor the bitter irony
with which the old Russuldar remarked,
that no doubt the wisdom of the <em>new-gentlemen</em>
(Sahiblogue, so they designate
the English) had shown them the folly
and ignorance of the gentlemen of the
old time, on whom it had pleased God,
nevertheless, to bestow the government
of India.”—(P. 17).</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr Robinson goes too far when
he taxes the rulers of the present
day with dislike to the natives generally;
but it is evident, from Mr
Campbell’s own admission, that there
is a strong prepossession in the minds
of the young men of his school against
all natives with any pretensions to
rank. This feeling extending to those
beyond the limits of our own dominions,
has stamped on our foreign policy
the character of our internal administration,
and found its full development
in the late Afghan war. Thirty or
forty years ago, when natives, if excluded
from office, were more often
admitted to familiar intercourse with
their European rulers, a mere regard
for our own character in the eyes of
our subjects would have withheld us
from making an unprovoked attack
upon an unoffending neighbour, and
thus incurring a certain loss of reputation
for a very uncertain amount of
gain. This view of the case does not
of course even occur to Mr Campbell
as one likely to be taken by any
reasonable being, and he sums up his
account of the Afghan war with the
following remarks, suggestive to our
minds of little beyond a most earnest
hope that the future advancement,
doubtless in store for one of his abilities,
may lead him far away from
meddling with matters either political
or military:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Such it was—a grievous military
catastrophe and misfortune to us, both
then and in our subsequent relations with
the country; but in no way attributable
to our policy, from which no such result
necessarily or probably flowed. To the
policy is due the expense, but not the
disaster.”—(P. 136).</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr Campbell has evidently not
made very minute inquiry into the
facts of the war, or he would never
have hazarded the assertion contained
in the following passage, that Sir
George Pollock literally paid his way
through the Khyber Pass:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Through the Western mountains only
has India been invaded; for beyond them
are all the great nations of Central India,
and they are penetrable to enemies
through one or two difficult passes. But
these passes are so narrow, difficult, and
easily defended, that <em>it is believed</em> that
no army, from Alexander’s down to
General Pollock’s, has ever passed without
bribing the mountain tribes. In the
face of regular troops and an organised
defence, all the armies in the world could
not force an entrance; but in the absence
of such a defence, experience proves that
the local tribes are always accessible to
moderate bribes.”—(P. 27).</p>

<p class='c008'>The absolute impracticability of any
mountain barrier is, we believe, disputed;
but, without offering any
opinion on that point, we are happy
to have it in our power to correct the
mistake into which the author has
fallen, in supposing that it was by
bribing that Sir George Pollock
carried his army through the Khyber
Pass. It is true that, in the anxious
time preceding our army’s movement
from Peshawar, negotiations had
been entered into with the local
tribes; but we have the most unquestionable
authority for asserting
that, before the march towards Cabool
began, the sum advanced to their
chiefs, being 20,000 rupees or £2000,
was demanded back from them by
the political agent on the frontier, and
actually repaid; so that the mountaineers
had not only the clearest
warning of the British general’s intention,
but the strongest possible
inducement to oppose him, as they
did to the utmost of their power.</p>

<p class='c009'>But our chief motive for alluding to
the Afghan war is, that we may show
how the spirit of the two schools, under
which, according to our theory, those
engaged in the work of Indian government
may now be classed, showed itself
even in the direction of our armies
in the field. Sir George Pollock was
there the representative of what would
be called by us the considerate and
moderate, by Mr Campbell the soft-hearted
and over-cautious school;
while Sir William Nott was at the
head of that which, going straight to
its object, tramples under foot, without
compunction, every consideration that
might hamper its freedom of movement.
We select but a few instances
in proof of our position, choosing
such as, from their notoriety, can be
cited without injury or offence.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the two avenging armies, the
one from Candahar on the south, the
other from Peshawar on the east,
drew nigh to Cabool, a powerful
party, consisting chiefly of the Kuzzilbashes
or Persians, who had never
taken part against us, prayed earnestly
that the citadel, the Bala
Hissar, might be spared to serve as a
place of refuge to themselves amid
the troubles likely to ensue on our
again evacuating the country.</p>

<p class='c009'>This prayer General Nott would
have rejected, and in so doing would
have gained the applause of every
member of that school by which concession
to the feelings of natives in
opposition to the requirements of
expediency, or the sternest justice, is
regarded as a proof of weakness.
With this prayer General Pollock
complied; and to his doing so may the
safety of the ladies and other prisoners,
in whose fate the whole civilised world
took so deep an interest, be ascribed;
for it was through the co-operation of
those thus conciliated that the Afghan
chief, charged with the custody of the
captives, was won over to assist in
their escape. General Nott was fortunately
the inferior in rank; for had
he commanded in chief, we have his
own words for the fact, that he would
have destroyed the Bala Hissar and
the City of Cabool, and marched on
with the least possible delay to Jellabad,
of course leaving the poor captives
to their fate; or, in words which,
from the manner of their insertion in
the pages of the historian, it is to be
feared he must have used, “throwing
them overboard.”—(<span class='sc'>Kaye’s</span> <cite>History of
the Afghan War</cite>, vol. i. pp. 617, 631).</p>

<p class='c009'>Incomplete indeed, to use Mr
Kaye’s words, would any victory
have been, if these brave men and
tender women, who had so well endured
a long and fearful captivity,
had been left behind; and it is well
to reflect that we were saved from
this reproach by the ascendancy of
the milder principles of rule in the
mind of the officer upon whom the
chief command at this moment, we
may almost say providentially, devolved.</p>

<p class='c009'>Many more instances are recorded,
in the chapter just quoted, of the influence
of a contrary spirit on the
closing events of the Afghan war;
but we must pass on to what happened
in Scinde, where the anti-judicial
principle may be said to have
reached its climax.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following is Mr Campbell’s short
and flippant account of that transaction,
reminding us in one passage
of a letter from the Empress Catherine
to one of her French correspondents,
wherein she congratulated herself

<p class='c010'>“But though we withdrew from Cabool,
our military experiences were not yet
over. On invading Afghanistan by the
Bolan Pass, Scinde became a base of our
operations, and troops were there cantoned.
When our misfortunes occurred,
it was supposed that the Beloch chiefs
would have liked to have turned against
us, but dared not—did not.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Major-General Sir C. Napier then
commanded a division in Bombay; he
was a good soldier, of a keen, energetic
temperament, but somewhat quarrelsome
disposition; had at one proud period of
his life been in temporary charge of a
petty island in the Mediterranean, but
was, I believe, deposed by his superior—most
unwisely, as he considered; and he
had ever since added to his military
ardour a still greater thirst for civil
power—as it often happens that we prefer
to the talents which nature has given
us those which she has denied us. He
was appointed to the command in Scinde;
and Lord Ellenborough, an admirer of
heroes, subsequently invested him with
political powers. He soon quarrelled
with the chiefs, and came to blows with
them. Their followers were brave, but
undisciplined, and they had no efficient
artillery. An active soldier was opposed
to them; he easily overcame them, declared
the territory annexed, and was
made Governor of Scinde.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, the Beloch chiefs had no other
right to the territory than the sword;
<em>and we, having the better sword, were perfectly
justified in taking it from them if
we chose</em>, without reference to the particular
quarrel between Sir Charles and
the chiefs, the merits of which have been
so keenly disputed, and on which I need
not enter. But the question <em>was one of
expediency</em>; and this premature occupation
of Scinde was not so much a crime
as a blunder,—for this very simple reason,
that Scinde did not pay, but, on the contrary,
was a very heavy burden, by which
the Indian Government has been several
millions sterling out of pocket.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Ameers had amassed, in their
own way, considerable property and
treasure, which the general obtained for
the army. He was thus rewarded by
an unprecedented prize-money, and with
the government of Scinde, while Bengal
paid the costs of the government he had
gained. Scinde was so great a loss, for
this reason—that it was not, like other
acquisitions, in the midst of, or contiguous
to, our territories, but was at that time
altogether detached and separated by the
sea, the desert, and the independent
Punjab; while on the fourth side it was
exposed to the predatory Beloches of the
neighbouring hills. Consequently, every
soldier employed there was cut off from
India, and was an expense solely due to
Scinde; and while a great many soldiers
were required to keep it, it produced a
very small revenue to pay them. It is,
in truth, very like Egypt—that is, it is
the fertile valley of a river running
through a barren country, where no rain
falls. But there is this difference—first,
that while no broader, it is not so long,
nor has the fine delta which constitutes
the most valuable portion of Egypt;
second, that while Egypt is free from
external predatory invasion, Scinde is
exceedingly exposed to it; and, thirdly,
that while Egypt has a European market
for its grain, Scinde has not. Altogether,
the conquest was, at the time, as
concerns India, much as if we had taken
the valley of the Euphrates.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Half a dozen years later, when we
advanced over the plain of the Indus,
and annexed the Punjab, we must have
arranged to control Scinde too, directly
or indirectly, as might be done cheapest;
but during those intermediate years it
was a gratuitous loss, and the chief cause
of the late derangement of our Indian
finances.”—(Pp. 137–139).</p>

<p class='c008'>The better sword gives the better
title! When such is the doctrine
maintained, even by a man of the
pen, we cannot wonder at its finding
a ready expositor in the man of the
sword.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, in truth, Mr Campbell’s sword
plea, having the merit of honesty and
openness, is by far the best that has
been advanced; and yet, as he shows,
it is only available in support of the
right, and not of the policy, of the
measure. After-events, he observes,
alluding to the conquest of the Punjab,
have given a value to Scinde,
which in itself it did not possess; but
he has omitted to remark that the one
event very probably grew out of the
other. The Sikhs, who not only had
refrained, like the Ameers, from molesting,
but had even assisted us in
our recent difficulties, had some reason
for apprehending that, in due time,
the policy pursued in Scinde would be
extended to their own more inviting
country; while, as if to remove an
obstacle to an apparently desired misunderstanding,
Sir George Clerk was
promoted to the nominally higher
post of lieutenant-governor of Agra,
and an officer, his very opposite in
every quality excepting earnest zeal
and undaunted courage, was appointed
to be his political successor at Lahore.</p>

<p class='c009'>Though he is little disposed to state
any case too favourably for the party
opposed to us, this peculiarity in our
relations with the Sikhs, immediately
before their invasion of our territory,
is frankly admitted by Mr Campbell.
After mentioning various military
movements calculated to give them
alarm, he describes a political difficulty
as to certain lands belonging to
the Sikh state, lying on our side of
the Sutledge, which he says had been
so managed by two successive political
agents, Sir Claude Wade and
Sir George Clerk, that through their
personal influence “it had so happened
that our wishes were generally
attended to.” He thus concludes:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sir George Clerk having been promoted,
new men were put in charge of
our frontier relations, and seem to have
assumed as a right what had heretofore
been yielded to a good understanding.
In 1845 Major Broadfoot was political
agent. He was a man of great talent
and immense energy, but of a rather
overbearing habit. In difficult and delicate
times he certainly did not conciliate
the Sikhs.... Altogether, I believe the
fact to be, that had Sir George Clerk remained
in charge of our political relations,
the Sikhs would not have attacked
us at the time they did; it might have
been delayed: but still it was well that
they came when they did.”—(Pp. 142,
143.)</p>

<p class='c008'>The annexation of the Punjab followed
hard on the conquest of Scinde,
and both events may be regarded as
sequels to the Afghan expedition, and
this again as but a fuller development
of the anti-judicial school, which, since
the downfall of the Cornwallis system,
has held almost undisputed sway on
the banks of the Ganges.</p>

<p class='c009'>When a government essentially despotic,
like that of British India, spontaneously
engages to adhere to the
rules of judicial procedure in dealing
with its own subjects, a pledge is
thereby given to neighbouring states
that towards them also its conduct
will be regulated on principles of justice
and moderation.</p>

<p class='c009'>We admit that the ruling power
may thus sometimes create obstructions
to its own progress along the
path of improvement; but it seems
probable that such self-imposed restraints
should more frequently operate
(to borrow a term from the railway)
as “breaks” to save it from
precipitately rushing into acts of rashness
or injustice.</p>

<p class='c009'>History confirms these conclusions,
and shows the practical result to have
been precisely what <em>a priori</em> reasoning
would have led us to expect.</p>

<p class='c009'>Five great wars were waged in
India during the second or judicial
period of its administration—that is,
from 1793 to 1830. These were—the
Mysore war in 1799, the Mahratta
war in 1803, the Nepaul war in 1814,
the Pindaree war in 1817, and the
Burmese war in 1825. There is not
one of these against which even a
plausible charge of injustice can be
maintained by our bitterest foreign
foes, or most quick-sighted censorious
countrymen.</p>

<p class='c009'>The acuteness of Mr Cobden himself
would be at fault if he were to
try to make out a case against the
authors of any one of these wars, to
satisfy a single sensible man beyond
the circle of the “Peace Society.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But how is it with the wars which
have occurred since, wandering from
judicial ways, the rulers of Gangetic
India have pursued whatever course
for the moment found favour in their
own eyes, with little or no reference
to the feelings of their subjects, and
with hardly a show of deference to
the laws enacted by their predecessors?</p>

<p class='c009'>The Afghan war of 1838, the Scinde
affair of 1843, the Gwalior campaign
of 1844, have each in their turn, especially
the two first-named, been made
the subject of comments neither captious
nor fastidious, but resting on
indisputable evidence, and supported
by reasoning such as pre-formed prejudice
alone can resist. The two wars
in the Punjab come under the category
of the just and necessary; and
Lord Hardinge’s generous use of the
privileges of victory, at the close of
the first of these hard-fought conflicts,
did much to re-establish our character
for justice and moderation. But still
these wars are, we fear, coupled in the
minds of the people of India with
those out of which they sprang, and
share in the reproach attaching, in
their estimation, to the invasion of
Afghanistan and the conquest of
Scinde.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have now reached a point
where we may stop to consider the
several merits of the works on our
list at the head of this article. Mr
F. H. Robinson’s pamphlet is written
in a frank conversational style, indicative
of his earnest sincerity and his
real sympathy with the people of the
Upper Ganges, among whom his official
life has been spent. We could
wish occasionally that his language
was a little more measured, for there
are passages to startle some of his
readers, and so to impair the general
effect of his otherwise interesting
pamphlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of the style, as well as the matter,
of Mr Campbell’s more elaborate
work, hardness is the chief characteristic.
Indeed, he seems to discard
all ornament from the one, and all
sentiment from the other, and to aim
at nothing beyond correctness as to
his facts, and positiveness as to his
deductions. In this he fully succeeds.
His volume is a repertory of useful
facts, and his conclusions can never
be misapprehended. Some of Mr
Campbell’s descriptions also are
amusing; and we insert, as a specimen
of his lighter style, the following
sketch of the day of a magistrate and
collector in Upper India, that functionary
whose labours are so little
known to any but those of his own
service, or the people among whom
he lives. After enumerating many
out-of-door duties despatched in the
course of an early morning’s ride, the
description thus proceeds:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“At breakfast comes the post and the
packet of official letters. The commissioner
demands explanation on this matter,
and transmits a paper of instructions
on that; the judge calls for cases which
have been appealed; the secretary to
Government wants some statistical information;
the inspector of prisons fears
that the prisoners are growing too fat;
the commander of the 105th regiment
begs to state that his regiment will halt
at certain places on certain days, and
that he requires a certain quantity of
flour, grain, hay, and eggs; Mr Snooks,
the indigo-planter, who is in a state of
chronic warfare with his next neighbour,
has submitted his grievances in six folio
sheets, indifferent English, and a bold
hand, and demands instant redress, failing
which he threatens the magistrate
with Government, the supreme court, an
aspersion of his character as a gentleman,
a Parliamentary impeachment, a letter to
the newspapers, and several other things
besides. After breakfast he despatches
his public letters, writes reports, examines
returns, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c011'>“During this time he has probably a
succession of demi-officials from the neighbouring
cantonments. There is a great
complaint that the villagers have utterly,
without provocation, broken the heads of
the cavalry grass-cutters, and the grass-cutters
are sent to be looked at. He goes
out to look at them, but no sooner appears
than a shout announces that the villagers
are waiting in a body, with a slightly different
version of the story, to demand justice
against the grass-cutters, who have
invaded their grass-preserves, despoiled
their villages, and were with difficulty
prevented from murdering the inhabitants.
So the case is sent to the joint
magistrate. But there are more notes;
some want camels, some carts, and all
apply to the magistrate; then there may
be natives of rank and condition, who
come to pay a serious formal kind of
visit, and generally want something; or a
chatty native official who has plenty to
say for himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All this despatched, he orders his
carriage or umbrella, and goes to cutcherry—his
regular court. Here he finds
a sufficiency of business; there are police,
and revenue, and miscellaneous cases
of all sorts, appeals from the orders of his
subordinates, charges of corruption or
misconduct against native officials. All
petitions from all persons are received
daily in a box, read, and orders duly
passed. Those setting forth good grounds
of complaint are filed under proper headings;
others are rejected, for written reason
assigned. After sunset, comes his
evening, which is probably like his morning
ride, mixed up with official and demi-official
affairs, and only at dark does the
wearied magistrate retire to dinner and
to private life.”—(Pp. 248–249).</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr Kaye’s essay recommends itself
by the same easy flow of language as
made his <cite>History of the Afghan War</cite>
such agreeable reading. His plan
does not admit of his giving more
than a series of sketches; but his outlines
are so clear, and his selection of
topics to fill up with is so happy, that
we can safely recommend his volume
to any one who, without leisure or
inclination for more minute study of
the subject, may still wish to obtain
some general idea of the administration
of our vast Eastern empire. In
a note at page 661, Mr Kaye informs
us, that in the summer of 1852 the
Duke of Newcastle told the Haileybury
students that, during a recent
tour in the Tyrol, he had met an intelligent
Austrian general who, in the
course of conversation on our national
resources, said that he could understand
all the elements of our greatness
except our Anglo-Indian empire, and
<em>that</em> he could not understand. The
vast amount of administrative wisdom
which the good government of such
an empire demanded, baffled his comprehension.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Austrian general, perhaps,
would not have readily assented to
the explanation of the marvel given
by the young French naturalist, Victor
Jaquemont, who, in a letter dated
from the confines of Tartary, in
August 1830, thus writes to a relative
in Paris: “The ideas entertained
in France about this country are
absurd; the governing talents of the
English are immense; ours, on the
contrary, are very mediocre; and we
believe the former to be embarrassed
when we see them in circumstances
in which our awkwardness would be
completely at a stand-still.”—(<cite>English
translation of Victor Jaquemont’s Letters</cite>,
vol. i. p. 169).</p>

<p class='c009'>The lady whose three volumes come
next under our notice is certainly
one of the most intelligent travellers
of her sex who has visited India since
the days when Maria Graham, afterwards
Lady Callcott, amused her
readers in England, and enraged
many of her female acquaintances in
India, by describing the latter as
generally “under-bred and overdressed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It is curious to observe how little
change the lapse of forty years seems
to have made in the outward peculiarities
of Anglo-Indian drawing-room
life, and how much in unison
the two fair authors are in their remarks
on their own countrymen.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs Colin Mackenzie, however, has
enjoyed opportunities which her predecessor
could not command, of observing
the private and domestic side
of Oriental life, and has evinced a
wonderful aptitude in turning these
opportunities to the best account. The
great charm of her work is that it
admits us within the Purdah, and lets
us see what is hidden from all European
masculine eyes,—the interior,
namely, of an Asiatic household.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is pleasing to read an English
lady’s lively account of her own
friendly intercourse with families of
another faith, upon whom her industrious
energy, quickened and regulated
by a zeal for her own religion, openly
avowed and studiously exhibited as
her main motive of action, cannot,
we imagine, have failed to produce a
deep and lasting impression. We
trust that Mrs Mackenzie’s example
may be followed by many of our
countrywomen; for the information
in which, of all others, the English
functionaries in the East are most
deficient—that regarding natives in
their private and domestic sphere—is
precisely what our ladies alone have
the power to acquire and impart.
Mrs Mackenzie, it is true, mingled
chiefly with the Afghans, who are a
more attractive race than the people
of India.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Afghans, also, must have felt
inclined to open their hearts to the
wife of one who, both as a soldier in
the field, and afterwards as a captive
in their hands, had commanded the
sincere respect of those among whom
he was thrown. But though all cannot
have her advantages, there is no
lady whose husband holds office in
India, who, if she makes herself acquainted
with the languages of the
country, will not find native women
of rank and respectability ready to
cultivate her acquaintance, and thus
afford her the means of solving some
of those problems of the native character
which elude all the researches
of our best-informed public functionaries.
Having said thus much in
praise of Mrs Mackenzie’s book, we
cannot but censure most strongly the
attempt at spicing her work with
gossipping tales calculated to wound
the feelings of private individuals
among her own countrymen, and even
of the officers of her husband’s own
service, with whose characters she
deals with a most unsparing degree
of reproachful raillery, designating
individuals as Colonel A., Major B.,
or Captain C. of the — Regiment,
stationed at such a place, so that
there cannot be a doubt as to whom
the anecdotes, which are always to
the discredit of the parties, refer.</p>

<p class='c009'>The difficulty of commenting on a
posthumous work is much enhanced
when the author happens to have
been, like the late Sir Charles Napier,
one whose errors of the pen are more
than redeemed by a career of long
and glorious services. Still, though
this consideration may soften, it ought
not to silence criticism, for errors
never more require correction than
when heralded by an illustrious name.
An additional reason for not passing
over the last work of so distinguished
a man is, that it contains many admirable
remarks on the Native army,
well deserving to be detached from
the mass of other matter in which
they are imbedded. The contents of
the book may be classed under three
heads: Censure of individuals; censure
of public bodies; suggestive remarks
on the civil and military
administration of India.</p>

<p class='c009'>On whatever comes under the first
of these heads, our strictures shall be
brief.</p>

<p class='c009'>We find in the list of those censured,
the names of so many of the
best and ablest men who have taken
part in Indian affairs, either at home
or in the East, that we feel loth to
give any additional publicity to what
we have read with pain, and would
gladly forget. Public bodies being
fair targets to shoot at, the censures
coming under the second head are
open to no objection excepting such
as may arise from their not standing
the test of close examination. The
Court of Directors, the Supreme
Council of India, the whole body of
the Civil Service (with one or two
exceptions), the Political Agents, the
Military Board in Calcutta, and the
Board of Administration in the Punjab,
follow each other like arraigned
criminals in the black scroll of the
author’s antipathies. To notice all
that is advanced against those included
in this catalogue would be
impossible, for a few lines may contain
assertions which it would fill a
folio to discuss. Of the East India
Company, the instrument through
which India has been providentially
preserved from the corruptions of an
aristocratic and the precipitancy of
a more popular rule, Sir Charles
Napier’s view is not more enlarged
than what we might have got from
his own Sir Fiddle Faddle, of whom
he has left us (at page 253) so amusing
a description. Though capable, as
we shall soon see, of rising above the
prejudices of his profession on other
points, he looks at this singular Company
and its governing Court with
the eyes of a Dugald Dalgetty, who,
while pocketing the commercial body’s
extra pay, accounts it foul scorn to
be obliged to submit to such base and
mechanical control.</p>

<p class='c009'>But none are all bad, and we rejoice
to see it admitted at page 210 of the
unfriendly book before us, that “the
Directors, generally speaking, treat
their army well;” and at pages 49, 261,
that the Company’s artillery, formed
under the rule of these very Directors,
is “<em>superb</em>, second to none in the
world—perfect.” Yet it never seems
to have occurred to the author, that
those under whose rule one department
has reached perfection, are not
likely to blunder in every other, as in
his moments of spleen he made himself
believe. So able a man as Sir C.
Napier could not always be blind to
his own inconsistencies; and accordingly,
in the midst of some declamation
on what India might be under
royal government, he seems to have
been suddenly brought up by a thought
about what the Crown Colonies
really are.</p>

<p class='c009'>From this dilemma he escapes by
saddling one distinguished personage
with the blame of all that is wrong in
the colonies, and thus punishes Earl
Grey for the speech about Scinde,
made by Lord Howick, some ten
years ago, in the House of Commons.</p>

<p class='c009'>To the Supreme Council of India,
though he was one of their number,
the author never makes any but disparaging
allusions. Discontented with
being a commander-in-chief under a
ruling body, of which he was himself
a member, he sought to be recognised
as the head of a separate military
government. He wished, in short, to
be, not what the Duke of York was
in England, but what, under peculiar
circumstances, the Duke of Wellington
was in Spain during the war in the
Peninsula. In this he was not singular;
for we suspect that the real cause
of that uneasiness in their position,
stated at page 355, to have been manifested
by many of Sir C. Napier’s
predecessors, is to be found in a desire
on their part for such an independency
of military administrative power, as
is totally incompatible with the necessary
unity and indivisibility of a
government. Yet it is admitted that,
in England, “when war comes, the
war-minister is the real commander,”—(p. 220.)
The author evidently felt
how much this admission must tell
against his own complaints of undue
interference with his authority; for he
endeavours, by some feeble special
pleading, to abate its effect, and to
prove the “poor Indian general,” with
his £15,000 a year, to be more unfavourably
placed than his <em>confrère</em> in
England.</p>

<p class='c009'>One circumstance, however, is such,
that while the latter is excluded from
the Cabinet, the former can take his
seat at the Council-Board, and his
part in the guidance of the counsels of
the State.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is, we think, greatly to be regretted
that Sir C. Napier did not
more frequently avail himself of this
privilege, for by keeping apart from
the Supreme Council he lost the
benefit of free personal communication
with equals, and incurred the evil of
having none near him but subordinates,
whom he could silence by a
word or a look.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Civil Service is represented
simply as a nuisance requiring immediate
abatement.</p>

<p class='c009'>We are told that “a Civil form of
government is uncongenial to <em>barbarous</em>
Eastern nations.” There is some
truth in this, if a proper stress is laid
on the word <em>barbarous</em>. In the first
chapter of the fourth part of his work,
Mr Kaye has shown how, in reaching
the outskirts of civilisation, we are
brought into contact with rude tribes
like the Beloches in Scinde, “to whose
feelings and habits the rough ways of
Sir C. Napier were better adapted
than the refined tenderness or the
judicial niceties of the gentlest and
wisest statesman that ever loved and
toiled for a people.” But the error of
such reasoners as Sir C. Napier is,
that they would treat all India as barbarous,
and rule it accordingly. Now,
with all our respect for Sir C. Napier’s
talents, we doubt much whether he
would have governed the more civilised
provinces of Upper India better
than the late Mr Thomason, whom he
condescends to praise—(p. 37); or
managed the subtle and well-mannered
Sikhs with more tact and skill
than Sir George Clerk during the perilous
period of our disasters in 1841–42.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is true that the utter failure of
the system in operation in the Punjab
is confidently predicted at p. 366; but
it is consolatory to find, from the very
last Indian newspapers, that no progress
is making towards a fulfilment
of this prophecy; but that, on the
contrary, a reduction of taxation has
been effected by the Board, such as
would be felt as a boon by the tenant-farmers
of England, its influence
having been counteracted by nothing
but by the effects of an excessive
plenty.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is creditable to the candour of
the Bengal Civil Service, that its
members themselves furnish the information
to be turned against their
own body, and it is from a work published
by the Hon. F. J. Shore, in
1837, that Sir C. Napier has borrowed
his most plausible charges.</p>

<p class='c009'>On this we can only observe, that
Mr Shore, in his zeal for the improvement
of his own service, forgot that
what he wrote would be read by the
ignorant and the unfriendly; by those
who could not, and by those who would
not, comprehend the real scope and
meaning of his words.</p>

<p class='c009'>The faults imputed by him to his
brother civilians are mainly those of
manner, already noticed by ourselves
as being common to the English, generally,
in their deportment towards
strangers in every clime.</p>

<p class='c009'>If we were writing only for those
who know what British India is, our
ungrateful task of correcting errors
might here conclude; but it is upon
those to whom that country is unknown
that the work before us is calculated
to produce an impression, and
therefore we must try, in as few words
as possible, to point out one of its
most striking inaccuracies. On referring
to the pages noted below,<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c007'><sup>[37]</sup></a> the
reader will find a series of assertions,
to the effect that in Bengal the army
is scattered over the country for the
protection of the Civil servants. From
the <cite>Indian Register</cite> of this very year,
it appears that, in the country below
Benares, which, in extent and population,
is about equal to France, there
are only about ten battalions;<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c007'><sup>[38]</sup></a> the
half of these being stationed at Barrackpore,
in the immediate vicinity of
Calcutta. In the provinces above
Benares, under the rule of the Lieutenant-governor
at Agra, with a
somewhat smaller but more hardy
population, it appears that there are
thirteen stations occupied by regular
troops; of which eight are close to
large towns, such as in every country
require to be watched—or else purely
military posts. There are only five
other places where regular troops
seem to be stationed, and of these,
one is on the frontier of Nepaul.</p>

<p class='c009'>Admitting that the Civil power
derives its support from the knowledge
of a military force being at hand, still
the exhibition of the latter is as rare
on the Ganges as on the Thames;
and a magistrate would sink in the
opinion of his superiors, and of his
own service, if he were to apply for
the aid of troops in any but the extreme
cases in which such an application
would be warranted in England.
It would be just as rational to argue
that our provincial mayors and magistrates
in England are hated, because
troops are stationed at Manchester,
Preston, or Newcastle, as to adduce
the distribution of the regular Sepoys
in Bengal and Upper India as a proof
of the hatred borne to the Civil servants,
through whose administration
that vast region is made to furnish
forth the funds to support the armies
with which heroes win victories and
gather laurels.</p>

<p class='c009'>What is meant by “guards for
civilians” it is hard to guess. The
Lieutenant-governor at Agra is, we
believe, the only civilian, not in political
employ, who has a guard of
regulars at his house. In some places
in Upper India, regulars may be posted
at the Treasury, for the same reason
that a corresponding force is posted
at the Bank of England in the heart
of London; but even to the Treasuries
in the lower provinces no such
protection is given.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sir C. Napier, we suspect, has confused
the collector with the collections,
and fancied the force occasionally
posted to protect the latter to be,
in fact, employed to swell the state or
guard the person of the former. That
regular Sepoys should be employed to
escort treasure is much to be regretted;
but treasure is tempting, and the
mode of conveyance on carts very
tedious, the ways long, the country
to be traversed often very wild,
and the robbers in some quarters
very bold. It is not often that in
England bullion belonging to the
State has to be conveyed in waggons;
but when this happens, it is, we
think, usually accompanied by a party
of soldiers.</p>

<p class='c009'>It would be tedious to follow out
all the mistakes made about Chuprassees
and Burkundazes—the former
being a sort of orderly, of whom two
or three are attached to every office-holder,
military or civil, to carry
orders and messages, in a climate
where Europeans cannot at all hours
of the day walk about with safety;
and the latter being the constabulary,
employed in parties of about
fifteen or twenty at the various subdivisions
into which, for purposes of
police, each district is laid out. To
form them into battalions would be
to strip the interior of all the hands
wanted for the common offices of preventive
and detective police.</p>

<p class='c009'>We now gladly turn to the more
pleasing duty of pointing out the
brighter passages, and rejoice to draw
our reader’s attention to the strain of
kindly feeling towards the men and
officers of the Company’s army, both
European and Native, pervading the
whole work.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is pleasing to observe the anxiety
expressed by so thorough a soldier,
to see the armies of the Crown
and Company assimilated to each
other, and all “the ridiculous jealousies
entertained by the vulgar-minded
in both armies”<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c007'><sup>[39]</sup></a> removed.
It is delightful to read the assurance
given by such a man that, “under
his command, at various times, for
ten years, in action, and out of action,
the Bengal Sepoys never failed in
real courage or activity.”<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c007'><sup>[40]</sup></a> It is instructive
to learn from so great a
master in the art of war, that “Martinets
are of all military pests the
worst;”<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c007'><sup>[41]</sup></a> and still more so to read
his earnest and heart-stirring exhortations
to the younger of his own
countrymen not to keep aloof from
Native officers;<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c007'><sup>[42]</sup></a> and his declaration
that, even at his advanced age, he
would have studied the language of
the Sepoys, if his public duties had
not filled up all his time. Our space
will not allow us to give any specimens
of the author’s style. It is ever
animated and original. There was
no need of a signature to attest a
letter of his writing, for no one could
mistake from whom it came. Though
deformed by occasional outbursts of
spleen, our readers may find much to
admire in the narrative of the expedition
to Kohat.<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c007'><sup>[43]</sup></a> It will be well,
however, after reading it through, to
take up the <cite>Bombay Times</cite> of the 14th
of December last, to see what progress
is being made by the very
Board of Administration so contemptuously
spoken of in the narrative,<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c007'><sup>[44]</sup></a>
towards reducing the turbulent Afridee
tribes to a state of enduring submission
and good order.</p>

<p class='c009'>Long practice had given great fluency
to the author’s pen when employed
in what we may call anti-laudatory
writing, but this sometimes
led him into that most pardonable of
plagiarisms, the borrowing from himself,
as in the following sentence, at
page 118: “He,” meaning the Governor-General,
“and his politicals,
like many other men, mistook <em>rigour</em>,
with cruelty, for <em>vigour</em>.” If our
memory is to be relied on, this very
antithetical jingle may be found in a
pamphlet, published some twenty-five
years ago, about the alleged “misgovernment
of the Ionian Islands.”
The author’s political speculations,
when unwarped by prejudice, were
generally correct, and we fully concur
with him, and, we may add, with
his predecessor, the late Sir Henry
Fane, in the opinion expressed at
page 66, that the Sutledge “ought to
bound our Indian possessions;” and
we now fear that, having crossed
that river, we must also throw the
Indus behind us, and fulfil the prediction
hazarded at page 374, that,
“with all our moderation, we shall
conquer Afghanistan, and occupy
Candahar.” Sometimes, however,
his disposition to paint everything <i><span lang="fr">en
noir</span></i> has misled our author even upon
a military point, as in the following
instance: “The close frontier of Burmah
enables that power to press suddenly
and dangerously upon the capital
of our Indian Empire; and such
events are no castles in the air, but
threatening real perils. The Eastern
frontier, therefore, is not safe,”—(p. 364).</p>

<p class='c009'>In former days, when the Burmese
territories were dovetailed into our
district of Chittagong, there might
have been some ground for this opinion,
supposing the Burmese to have
been, what they are not, as energetic
a people as the Sikhs. But a glance at
the map might satisfy any one that with
our occupation of Arracan, a country
so intersected by arms of the sea as to
be impassable for any power not having
that absolute superiority on the
water which a single steamer would
give us, all danger of invasion from
that side has for the last twenty-five
years been at an end.</p>

<p class='c009'>The mention of Burmah naturally
leads to the next work in our list,
that of Mr J. C. Marshman, the well-known
editor of the ablest of the Calcutta
journals, the <cite>Friend of India</cite>.</p>

<p class='c009'>His pamphlet is a reply to another,
by Mr Cobden, entitled “The origin
of the Burmese war.” Mr Cobden
could not, of course, write about a
war excepting to blame it, consequently
Mr Marshman appears in defence
of what the other assails.</p>

<p class='c009'>We cannot devote much time to
the consideration of this controversy,
but at one passage we must indulge
in a momentary glance.</p>

<p class='c009'>Towards the end of the fifth page
of Mr Marshman’s pamphlet our readers
will find a sentence throwing
some light on the origin of the war
which he undertakes to defend. He
there dwells, with great emphasis, on
the “unexampled and extraordinary
unanimity which was exhibited by
the Indian journals on the Burmese
question,” and describes, with much
unction, the happy spectacle of rival
editors laying aside their animosities,
to combine in applauding the course
pursued on that occasion by the Government.
Editors, like players, must
please, to live; and as the whole
Anglo-Saxon community in the East,
most especially those of the shipping
and shopping interest at Calcutta,
have, for the last twenty-five years,
had a craving for a renewal of war
with Ava, the newspaper must have
been conducted upon most disinterested
principles, which had opposed
itself to any measure conducive to so
desiderated a result.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have now skimmed over the
annals of a hundred years, endeavouring,
as we moved along, to detect the
ruling principle of each successive
period, and to trace its influence upon
the leading events of the time.</p>

<p class='c009'>In looking forward to what is to
come, we shall not speculate on the
spontaneous limitation of conquest,
because we feel that this will never be;
for this simple reason, that we shall
never sincerely wish it to be. Wars,
then, will go on, until, on the north-west,
we shall have accomplished all
that Sir C. Napier either predicted or
recommended, and until, on the south-east,
we shall have added Siam to
Pegu, and Cambodia to Siam. Within
the geographical boundaries of India
Proper, also, there are several tempting
patches of independent territory
to be absorbed, such as the Deccan
and Oude, both of which, along with
the Rajpoot and Bondela states, are
all marked like trees in a forest given
up to the woodman. The inexhaustible
plea for interminable conquest,
internal mal-administration, will ever
furnish grounds for the occupation of
the larger states; and though many
of the smaller Hindoo principalities
are admirably governed, according to
their own simple notions, still, as
they certainly will not square with
our ideas of right, some reason will
always be found to satisfy the English-minded
public that their annexation
is both just and expedient.
Then we shall, indeed, be the sole
Lords of Ind; but after destroying
every independent court where natives
may hope to rise to offices of
some little dignity, we shall be doubly
bound to meet, by arrangements of
our own, the cravings of natural and
reasonable ambition.</p>

<p class='c009'>In searching for a guide at this point
of our inquiry, we have hit upon the
work standing last upon our list, the
production of a gentleman who has
extraordinary claims upon the attention
of English as well as Indian
readers. Mr Cameron carried out
with him to India a mind stored with
the best learning of the West; and
during twelve years spent out there
in the high posts of Law Commissioner,
Member of the Supreme Council,
and President of the Committee
of Education, his best powers were
exerted, not merely to impart instruction,
but to inspire with a true love of
knowledge, the native youth attached
to the various institutions within the
sphere of his influence.</p>

<p class='c009'>His work is truly one of which his
country may be proud, for a more
disinterested zeal in the cause of a
conquered people was never exhibited
by one of the dominant race, than is
evinced in this noble address to the
Parliament of England on behalf of
the subject millions of India.</p>

<p class='c009'>Many, however, as Mr Cameron’s
qualifications are for the task which
he undertakes, there is one of much
importance not to be found among
them. He never served in the interior;
never was burdened with the charge
of a district; never spent six hours
a day, at the least, in the crowded
Babel of a Cutcherry,<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c007'><sup>[45]</sup></a> with the thermometer
at 98° in the shade. His
Indian day was very different from
that of the magistrate collector of
which we have inserted Mr Campbell’s
lively description. It was passed
in the stillness of his library, or in
the well-aired and well-ordered halls
of a college, among educated young
natives, mostly Bengalees, who were
about as true specimens of Indian
men as the exotics in a London conservatory
are of British plants.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such a life is compatible with the
acquirement of great Oriental lore,
but not with the attainment of that
ready knowledge of native character
which is picked up by far inferior intellects
in the rough daily school of
Cutcherry drudgery.</p>

<p class='c009'>This reflection has somewhat damped
our pleasure in perusing Mr Cameron’s
eloquent and high-toned address.
We devoutly hope to see our
misgivings proved to be groundless;
but in the mean time we must give
one or two of our reasons for doubting
whether the day is at hand when
the natives of England and India may
meet on terms of perfect parity in
every walk of life. In the first place,
to judge by precedent, we doubt the
strict applicability to the present question
of that drawn from the practice
of ancient Rome. Of the people subjugated
by Rome, a vast proportion
were of the same race as their victors,
with no peculiarities, personal or complexional,
to check the amalgamation
resulting from popular intermarriage.
It is in Egypt that the closest similarity
to our situation in India is
likely to be found, and, judging by
the contemptuous tone of Juvenal’s
allusion to the people of that country
in his 15th Satire, we can hardly imagine
that, when employed in any public
capacity, the “<span lang="la">imbelle et inutile
vulgus</span>” were placed exactly on the
same footing as the Roman knights
who constituted the “covenanted
service” of those days in that particular
province.</p>

<p class='c009'>The geographical circumstances
were also different. Rome grew like
a tree—its root in the eternal city, its
branches stretching forth in continuous
lines to the furthest extremities of
its vast domain.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our Indian empire springs from a
transplanted offshoot of the parent
State. No one part of it has a firmer
hold on the soil than another. It is
all equally loose. Our dominion is,
in fact, based upon our ships, and it is
to our ships that both Englishmen and
natives, in touching on the possibility
of our eventual downfall, always speak
of our retreating or being driven.
From our ships we sprung, and to our
ships we shall some day perhaps return.
It is in vain, therefore, to draw,
from the practice of a purely continental
empire like that of Rome, rules
for the government of an essentially
maritime dominion such as we have
established on the Ganges. Ours is a
power without a precedent, and perhaps,
therefore, without a prognostic.
There is nothing like it in the past,
and its future will probably be stamped
with the same singularity as has
characterised its whole existence.</p>

<p class='c009'>We must try, therefore, to better
the condition of our subjects by means
such as our own experience teaches
us to be best adapted to their nature.
To open to them at once the civil and
military services; to give to any number
of them that absolute right to preferment
implied in their enrolment in
the ranks of a peculiar body, would
not, we imagine, be to follow the
guidance of experience. Presumption
on the one side, and the pride of race
on the other, might lead to serious
jarrings between the English and the
Indian members, who, though standing
in the ranks of the same service,
would still differ from each other like
the keys of a piano-forte. It would,
we think, be safer to commence, as we
have already suggested, by selecting
for preferment individuals from the
mass of our native subjects. Situations
in the judicial and revenue department
may be found or created
which natives can fill with great credit;
but their general fitness for the
office of magistrate remains to be
proved. It is easy to imagine a case
wherein to leave the powers wielded
by a magistrate in the hands of any
one open to the influences from which
a fellow-countryman alone can be secure,
would be, to say the least, most
imprudent. Besides, there is a duty,
perhaps but imperfectly performed at
present, and to which, at least in the
lower provinces, a native functionary
would be quite incompetent, and that
is, affording protection to the people
against the violence of Englishmen
settled in the interior as merchants,
landholders, or Indigo-planters. We
have now before us a letter written in
excellent English by a native of Bengal,
in which the following passage
occurs:—“The fact is, that European
traders have obtained, in many
places in the interior of the Bengal
Presidency, almost uncontrolled power—a
power which they are seldom sufficiently
scrupulous not to exert to the
injury of those with whom they come
in contact. It is not exaggeration to
say, each Indigo-factory, together
with its surrounding estate, is a little
kingdom within itself, wherein avarice
and tyranny hold unlimited sway.
The police is too feeble to render
effectual aid in suppressing the lawless
oppression of the factor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, let us figure to ourselves one
of Mr Cameron’s slender dusky <i><span lang="fr">élèves</span></i>
on the bench as magistrate, and (to
take what ought to be the mildest
specimen of a gentle Englishman) the
leading member of the Peace party at
the House of Commons at the bar in
an Indigo-planter, taxed with oppressing
the Hindoo, and we shall easily
see that the law must have an almost
supernatural inherent majesty, if, under
such circumstances, it can be
effectually enforced and impartially
administered.</p>

<p class='c009'>The regulation of the intercourse
between our own countrymen not in
the service of Government, and our
native subjects, will rise in importance
with the progress of those works
in which European agency is essential
to insure success. Railways,
electric telegraphs, improved cotton-cultivation,
steam, and all other complicated
machinery, must, if overspreading
the country as many anticipate,
bring with them a vast increase
to the European section of the community,
whose influence will still be
out of all proportion to its commercial
strength.</p>

<p class='c009'>To give to this little section full
scope for the development of its industrial
energies, and yet to restrain
it from abusing its strength to the
injury of the native population, is in
fact the only real service ever likely
to be rendered by the Law Commissions
and Legislative Councils called
into existence by the enactment of
last session.</p>

<p class='c009'>In as far as the natives of Bengal
and Upper India are alone concerned,
we are convinced that all of this cumbrous
law-making apparatus is quite
superfluous. The existing regulations,
with occasional pruning and trimming,
would, if fairly enforced and adhered
to, amply suffice to meet all of their
simple wants. But the natives can
no longer be left to themselves. Europeans
will intrude, and legislation
must therefore be shaped and stretched
so as to fit it to the characters of the
intruders.</p>

<p class='c009'>As at present constituted, the magistracy
and the police are hardly
equal to the control of British-born
settlers, half a dozen of whom are
more difficult to rule than half a million
of natives. There prevails among
Englishmen of every grade a notion
of the East India Company being a
body of a somewhat foreign stamp, to
whose servants it is almost degrading
for a free-born Britain to be obliged
to submit.</p>

<p class='c009'>The amalgamation of the Queen’s
and the Company’s superior tribunals,
known at Calcutta as the Supreme,
and the Sudder, Courts, would, by
coupling the home-bred judges appointed
by the Crown with the country-trained
nominees of the local government,
give a weight to the magistracy
acting under this combined authority,
and thus fit it for the better discharge
of the difficult duty of controlling and
correcting the excesses of Englishmen
settled in the interior. These settlers
often find in the menace of an action
or prosecution before a remote and
somewhat prejudiced tribunal, a weapon
wherewith to combat the immediate
power of a functionary, amenable
individually to the Queen’s Court
in Calcutta, for every act which legal
ingenuity can represent to be personal,
and so beyond the pale of official protection.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fusion of the two superior
courts will not, in fact, lessen the personal
responsibility of the English
magistrate; but it will remove an apparent
antagonism, calculated to keep
alive a spirit of defiance towards the
<em>local</em> authority in the breast of many
an English settler, the effects of which,
as described in the extract above
given, from the letter of a Bengal
gentleman, are felt by every native
with whom he may have any dealings.
Much has been written and
spoken about the duty of protecting
the people of India from being oppressed
by the Government and its
agents, but few seem to have thought
of that more searching tyranny which
a few strong-nerved and coarse-minded
Englishmen in the interior, invested
with power by the possession of land,
may exercise over the people among
whom they are located, and from whom
they are eager to extract the wealth
which they long to enjoy in a more
congenial climate.</p>

<p class='c009'>This species of tyranny will of
course be most felt among the feeblest,
and is, consequently, likely to be more
grievous in Bengal than among the
hardier population of Upper India.
But wherever the Anglo-Saxon goes,
he will carry with him his instinctive
contempt for tribes of a dusky complexion;
and where this is not counteracted
by the imposed courtesies of
official life, or checked by the presence
of a sufficient controlling authority, it
will ever be ready to break out in a
manner injurious to the interests and
feelings of those subject to his power.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our future rule will, it is evident,
become daily more and more European
in its tone, and there will consequently
be an increasing call upon those engaged
in its direction to watch over
the conduct of the dominant race, to
restrain its arrogance, and to see that
the equality announced in the laws
does not evaporate in print, but is
something real and substantial, to be
felt and enjoyed in the ordinary everyday
intercourse of life.</p>

<p class='c009'>If this can be accomplished by
legislation, the new Commissions and
Councils will not have been created in
vain; but if their labours end in
merely adding to the existing tomes
of benevolent enactments, without
effectual provision for their enforcement,
then we cannot but fear that
our projected measures of improvement,
being all of a European character,
will add little to the happiness
of our subjects on the banks of the
Ganges, and be regarded by them
merely as ingenious contrivances for
extending our own power, and completing
their subjugation.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Willoughby family, as has
been already said, left England for
the Continent; and the spring which
succeeded Sir John’s death found
them temporarily residing in Paris.
It was very far from the Colonel’s
intention, however, to remain there
long; the household was only incomplete,
as yet, without Francis, who
in a few weeks would join it on leaving
Oxford; and there had to be
some consideration before finally settling,
from among no slight variety of
advertisements in the public journals,
what district of the provinces might
be best suited for a retreat, probably
during some years. One or two
points of business, also, requiring
attention to his English letters, continued
to make their early arrival a
convenience; not so much from the
Devonshire lawyer, whose methodical
regularity left nothing to desire, as
with regard to the sale of Sir Godfrey’s
commission, and some arrangements
left unfinished in town, of that
tedious nature which characterises
stockbroking. Meanwhile their establishment
was certainly simple compared
with that lately given up in
Golden Square, where society, at no
time deficient to the Willoughbies,
had, since the Colonel’s last return
home, been doubling itself every year,
and had begun, since his brother’s
death, absolutely to send visiting-cards
by footmen, to call in carriages,
to bespeak the earliest possible share
of their company at dinner: contrasted
with the extent which must
have been necessary for Stoke, it was
diminutive. Yet it was by no means
one of a restricted kind, although
the income from Lady Willoughby’s
own small fortune would alone have
sufficed to keep it up, leaving some
surplus; so that, living as yet without
new acquaintances, and, so far as
their countrymen were concerned, in
perfect obscurity, they had not a wish
which it did not suffice for; as long,
at least, as the vast, strange city
held its first influences over them.
To these, probably, it was owing that
Colonel Willoughby appeared for
some time to have had no other object
in coming to Paris; if distinctly
aware of any, beyond the facilities
there for choosing a place of residence
in the provinces, for awaiting his son
Francis, and finishing the more important
part of his correspondence,
with the convenience of respectable
banking-houses—besides the possibility
of avoiding English acquaintances,
which at Dieppe or Boulogne would
not have been so easy—then he would
without doubt have mentioned it to
his wife. A reserved man, and in
the strictest sense a proud one, he
was amongst the last to have secrets;
they would have sat on his brow,
and troubled his manner; nor had he
at any time had such a thing apart
from <em>her</em>. During the whole course
of their wedded life, whether together
or separated, by word or letter, their
mutual confidence had increased: for
her part, she was of that easy, placid,
seemingly almost torpid nature,
which, save in a receipt of housekeeping,
or a triumph of domestic
management, appears merely to produce
in it nothing worth the hiding,
nor to receive, either, anything of
that serious kind; while the course
of time, that had begun to turn the
fair features of Mrs Willoughby rather
large, giving her form a somewhat
more than matronly fulness, had so
increased this peculiarity in her disposition
as to make strangers think
her insipid. Older friends thought
very far otherwise, and it was, in
some way, chiefly old friends Mrs
Willoughby had had at all; but neither
they, the oldest of them, nor even
her children, perhaps, could so much
as imagine the truth of heart, the perfect
trust, the intimate, unhesitating
appreciation, which, since they were
first gained by him, her husband had
been ever knowing better. Indolently
placid as she might seem even to
ordinary troubles, tumults, and embarrassments,
as if the world’s care
entered no imagination of hers—quietly
busied, with attention fixed
on household matters, knitting or
sewing in her endless, noiseless manner—yet
if his eye had shown anxiety,
if he had ceased to read, if he paced
the room, or had been very silent, a
kind of divination there was, that,
without any watching or any questioning,
would have roused her up—the
work suspended on her lap, her
cheek losing the old dimple-mark
which maturity had deepened there,
and her glance widened with concern;
till, if he had still not spoken, Lady
Willoughby would have risen up
gradually, looking round as if startled
from a sort of mild dream, and have
moved towards him, beginning of her
own accord—which was a rare thing—to
speak. Not necessarily, indeed,
though they had been alone in the
room, to invite confidence by any inquiry;
but rather in the way of performing
some slight office that might
have been neglected, or with endeavours
at such interesting news and
small-talk as, to speak truth, she
scarcely shone in, unsupported—nor
any the better for the confused sense
she evidently had at these times of
having been by some means in fault,
and having failed to be a very lively
companion. She was of a plain
country squire’s family, in fact; and
in her day, if sent at all to boarding-schools,
they had not lingered long
over music, still less at flower-painting
or the sciences; while with successive
sisters waiting at home for
their turn, as she had had, it was but
to finish off baking and mending, with
dancing and embroidery, then to come
back, and bake and mend again. So
when the dancing ended with marriage,
the embroidery at the first
birth, it might have been thought the
officer had gained no very valuable
society, sometimes in barrack-lodgings,
sometimes abroad, sometimes
for distant communication by letter;
she might, at least, have been expected
to form no great ornament in
London circles, or among country
people at Stoke Manor-house. Still
there had been nothing in all their
previous intercourse so precious to
him as his wife’s letters, when almost
for the first time, in her own natural
way, she had to attempt expressing
fond thoughts, soothing motives, and
yet confessions of impatience—mixed
up with accounts of children’s complaints,
their faults, and their schooling—country
gossip, and fashionable
arrivals, with some stray suggestions
and admissions, never before confided
to him, of a pious kind: and when
long afterwards came the events at
Stoke, instead of any undue flutter or
sense of importance being caused in
her, she had fallen in as naturally to
title or prospects, as she had sat before
that at the head of their dinner-table
in Golden Square. It was no
doll’s disposition, as had been at the
time hinted round some ill-natured
card-tables in that region; if one
thing more than another troubled Sir
Godfrey in their present plans, it was
that he believed devoutly in his wife’s
aptitude for a high station, where
expectations would be formed and
occasions raised; his feeling was—and
the partiality was excusable—that
her chief value lay obscured in
ordinary circumstances. Whereas at
the new abode in Paris, with ample
scope and convenience, all the earlier
habits of domestic superintendence
seemed returning, the making, baking,
mending—almost even to washing;
in reference to which alone Lady
Willoughby seemed really active, and
the more so that everything might go
on as in England, had the mere economy
of the thing not been a vital
point. Her pleased air would alone
have hindered him from reasoning it
with her, had Sir Godfrey so much
as dreamt, in the latter respect, how
their case really stood: and when,
indeed, there did lie any care on his
mind, which he might be unwilling
she should share, yet so gently did
the conversation win it from him, and
so quietly did something like the old
manner woo him to bear no burden
alone, that, ere he knew, it was no
longer his, but they were talking of
it plainly. What tranquil reassurance
<em>then</em>, and grave, prompt advertence
to the point—and pure
sympathy, and that repose of soul
from which a woman’s instinct can
express so much by a tone, a look,
silence itself! Sir Godfrey had sometimes
been ashamed to find how much
more he could be disturbed by trifles,
or how cautiously he had been underrating
his wife’s affection. So that
she knew as well as he did, and almost
as soon, how affairs stood at
Stoke, with the tenor of his brother’s
intended will, and any the slightest
incident which could concern them.
He had even casually mentioned, as
among the more trivial, Sir John’s
wishes for the benefit of the person
entitled Suzanne Deroux, for Lady
Willoughby had long known, of
course, what of Sir John’s early history
his brother knew. The matter
had well-nigh escaped his memory,
he said; till on happening to want a
banker in Paris, it struck him that
the house formerly employed by his
brother, in the payment of the annuity
referred to, might suit himself.
To these gentlemen, accordingly, he
had sent a memorandum of the address
left by Sir John, with a request
that they would have the money paid
to her. It was a small sum, but
might be important to the people,
whoever they were, living in one of
the poorest and most wretchedly-crowded
quarters of Paris. Still, as
Sir Godfrey smiled on that occasion
cheerfully, and resumed his English
newspaper, he did not, he could not
tell all the painful and pertinacious
impressions, of circumstances unknown
or acts untraced, which any
allusion to his late brother’s former
stay in Paris still called up.</p>

<p class='c009'>Everything did not exactly go on
in the household as in England, indeed,
but all was as nearly so as a
quiet assiduity could make it. The
house, a somewhat dull and dilapidated
mansion, very barely furnished,
and taken by the month from an adjoining
notary, stood far to the western
or court-end of the city, though
rather involved in the dinginess of a
sort of minor fauxbourg, where, in
those days, between the sudden curve
of the river and the lesser alleys of
the Champs Elysées, a motley population
still clustered about the tan-pits
or dye-houses, and towards the
bridge and quays: it occupied one
corner of a short, deserted-looking
street, the other end of which was reduced
to a narrow lane by the high
enclosure of a convent; in front was
a small paved court, very shady and
damp, by the help of two or three
stunted poplars it contained, yet not
by any means private, being overlooked
by dusty or broken staircase windows,
one over the other, from at
hand; while it, nevertheless, could
boast of a wall surmounted by a railing,
with a heavily-pillared gate of
open ironwork, a little lodge on one
side within, where the porter lived—at
one end of the house a diminutive
stable and coach-shed, at the other an
entrance to a high-walled garden, laid
out in intricate confusion, without
sign of flowers, and overgrown with a
luxury of weeds. Some rising bourgeois
had probably at first designed
it, with a moderate eye to fashion;
although its prime recommendation
from the notary was, that successive
families of the English nobility had
chosen it for their temporary residence;
nor did the old concierge fail
to point out, with some emphasis,
when showing the garden, that it was
in the English style. The place was,
at all events, at a convenient distance
from the central parts of Paris, and
within an easy drive to the Protestant
Episcopal chapel. At a sharp angle
with the street ran a main thoroughfare
from the city barrier, one way
confused in the dense suburb, the
other way breaking towards a leafy
promenade of the public park; sending
all day a busy throng of passengers
into that brighter current, where
it glimpsed broad past the gap of
light, with the glitter of equipages,
the shifting glow of dresses, and the
constant hum and babble of its gaiety;
while nearer by was an opening in
the contiguous street, through which
the first-floor windows of their house
looked at the motion along the quay,
and saw the stately piles of building
on the opposite bank, in brighter perspective,
curve away from the eastern
avenue of the Champ de Mars, with
the bending of the river. They had
still a carriage, too, though it was
merely hired by the month, like the
house, from the nearest livery-stables—a
light, English-shaped barouche,
with its pair of soot-black, long-legged
Flemish horses, long-tailed and square-nosed,
barrel-bodied and hollow-backed,
and formally-stepping, which the
owner called English also, for everything
English seemed the rage: they
were objects of no slight scorn, in that
light, to Sir Godfrey’s groom, a stiff
old trooper, who, with his duties towards
his master’s horse, Black Rupert
(the only possession they had
brought from Stoke, save the title), had
soon to unite that of coachman. Since
besides Jackson himself, there was
not merely an English housemaid, but
there was young Mr Charles’s tutor, a
grave, rather middle-aged bachelor of
arts from Cambridge, and in clerical
orders, who was to make up for the lost
advantages of Eton, while he looked
forward to the first opening in the
curacy at Stoke: there was Miss Willoughby’s
governess, a lady apparently
also of middle age, whose perfect
breeding and great accomplishments
had made her acceptance of the position
a favour, when the sudden necessity
arose for the young lady’s leaving
school; she had been in the highest
families, and her conversational powers
were of a superior order, so that
there was a continual silent gratitude
towards her on the part of Lady Willoughby.
To the latter, indeed, whose
whole heart lay in her family, these
unavoidable changes had been a source
of pure satisfaction, so far as she was
concerned; compared with the privilege
of having their children about
them, educated under their own eye,
expecting Frank so soon, too, nothing
else was a deprivation; she merely
missed England and English habits
when some one else did, and had
seen Stoke but once; only through the
occasional abstracted looks of Sir Godfrey
did she regret its postponement.
As for the old French concierge at the
gate, indeed, with his wife, family,
and friends, she could have gladly
spared them; but the concierge was
indispensable—he <em>lived</em> there—he
went with the house, in fact; and at
the very hint of his being superfluous,
the old cracked-voiced porter had
drawn himself up indignantly in his
chair, while his bare-armed, black-browed
wife had turned her leatherlike
face up from her tub, looking
daggers. True, the English family
had, in the mean time, no visitors,
but the concierge had;—<em>he</em> was well
known to his respectable neighbours;
and, besides, it was possible that
the misanthropy of the Chevalier
Vilby and of Madame might be to
some extent diminished; they would
probably yet enter into society—all
the previous tenants of the mansion
had done so; Paris was, in reality, so
attractive a capital. Such had been
the response to the diplomacy of Jackson,
who, having once been a French
prisoner, far abroad, knew the language
after a fashion of his own; and he received
it in grim silence. The truth
was, the gossipping receptions at the
little lodge were somewhat troublesome,
and seemed to concern themselves
greatly with the affairs of the
household within, had there been nothing
else than the general interest
taken in it by the adjacent windows,
or the popularity of the whole family,
collectively or individually, which had
sometimes accompanied their exit or
entrance with applause from crowds
of street children—a prestige which
had as evidently deserted them afterwards,
to be replaced by tenfold scrutiny
of a less partial kind, not unmingled
with sundry trivial annoyances.
Nor, although it resulted, with
Lady Willoughby’s usual easy disposition,
in her employing the services
of the porter’s daughter within the
house, did the one parent open the
gate with less sullen dignity, and the
other seem less jealously watchful
against some abstraction of the furniture,
or nocturnal evasion of the rent.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nevertheless, Paris itself was not
more restless or more lively than the
spirits of the young people in their
first enjoyment of its scenes. The
earliest summer had begun to lighten
up what was already bright with heat
that came before the leaves, quickly as
these were bursting into verdure along
every avenue; and when the dust is
hovering in the sun, when the level
light streams along causeway and
pavement, crossed by cooler vistas,
when the morning water-carts go
slowly hissing past, the shopmen
sprinkling their door-steps, putting
out their canopies, setting their windows
right—with the moist smell of
market-carts still in the air, the stray
fragrance of fruit-stalls near—steeples
shining high beyond the steel-blue
roofs, the dazzling skylight panes,—chambermaids
looking far out from
upper windows, long perspectives of
architecture blending, and a vast hollow
azure over all, ere the smoke is
gathered, and before the street-cries
are confused, or the growing rush of
sounds has become oppressive in the
heat—then who remembers not the
fairy feeling of a city to youth! It is
when they still look to life from under
protection, with no experience, nothing
like the need of directing for themselves;
but most of all from a simple
household, used to temperate pleasures,
and to the sort of kindness that
rests more in purpose than upon indulgence;
the city need only be Paris,
with sights as foreign as the language,
to crown that morning cup of enchantment
to its brim.  For the two
younger members of the family it
wore all its charm: Rose Willoughby
had seen little more of the world in
her boarding-school, at sixteen, than
if it had been a nunnery; while
Charles, who was younger, had been
fancying his knowledge of life at
Westminster school and Eton rather
uncommon;—so that every morning
set them astir early, watching at the
windows, impatient to get breakfast-time
past, to have those studies severally
over, in which, so far as the lad’s
tutor was concerned, Mr Thorpe bore
the chief difficulties of the task. Each
day, in fact, found the party rolling
farther from the shady environs,
through into the hot heart of the city,
towards scenes or structures that
were multiplied by each previous discovery:
for if the long stately façades
of the Tuileries, from its formal gardens
swarming with people and statues,
ran already half-linked to the gorgeous
old Louvre, steeped pale in the
southern flood of light above the river,
till all its deep-set, embossed windows
seemed diamonds in the rich Corinthian
filagree that framed them, though
the workmen were still busy at its unfinished
roof, like emmets from the
crowd along the quays; so these also
pointed to the Palais Royal court,
with its new arcades and glittering
shops—or, again, far through the
labyrinth of exhaustless streets, where
moted and dusty shadows plunged
into the gloom of deep lanes, to the
grim grey towers of the Bastille rising
embattled out of the squalid fauxbourg,
which blackened in manufactory
smoke beyond—miles back, too,
it led across some bridge, to the
Gobelins, to the close and dingy
quarter of the university, with its old
legends of learning, or magic in dark
ages; its careless students swaggering
past, or smoking from their high-perched
casements; its grisettes, that
sat at work opposite with an air of
coquettish grace amidst their poverty,
their hair neither frizzed nor powdered,
with a bright cotton handkerchief
twined half about it, watering their
little mignonette-boxes, or chirping
to their bird-cages that hung outside
to a gleam of sunshine;—or to where
the golden dome of the great hospital
hung in the air, faintly bright; to
the bronze form of Henry of Navarre
riding regardless above the throng of
the market-place, and where the two
huge cathedral-towers of Notre Dame
stood over their mountain of roof,
above the gaunt old houses of the
island Cité; with the sharp-peaked
prison-turrets and grated loopholes of
the Conciergerie lifted from the river’s
edge, whose muddy eddies swam each
way by, among the barges. The
Colonel had been in Paris many years
before, ere he had had any interest in
it save that of a young man, in lively
company; when all sons of gentlemen
made the grand tour, and the old
glories of Versailles were still reflected
even at the court of Louis Quinze, in
the elegant dissipation of his latter
days: he had come since then, indeed,
into sterner contact with Frenchmen
abroad; but it served him now, in
making shift to act as guide among
the principal wonders of the capital—when
he rode near the carriage, sometimes
accompanied by Mr Thorpe, the
tutor, on a quiet white mare from the
hackney stables. And Lady Willoughby
mildly eyed the Bastille, or
gently noticed the sumptuousness of
the Louvre, at her husband’s remark;
suffering herself to be handed out to
some sentinel-guarded vestibule, and
led along some chill historical corridor,
although it might cost a
shudder at what was told of it; if
some positive domestic duty did
not rather keep her all day at home.
While Mrs Mason, the governess,
following with the party, would
sedulously express assent, at due intervals,
by word or sign, to the statements
of the baronet; not seldom addressing
to the young lady beside her
some comment of her own, or improving
inference, such as Mrs Trimmer
had recently brought into educational
vogue. It might have been that Rose
on these occasions sometimes caught
her brother’s eye, so that her absorbed
face and lighted look would grow all
at once intensely demure, or she had
to turn away to hide a smile at his air
of exaggerated attention; while Mr
Thorpe was usually so deep in abstraction,
or had wandered so far, as to be
in danger of their leaving him altogether
behind. It was all one storm
of spectacle and excitement, in fact,
to the two; antique memories mingling
in it with the record of fearful deeds,
and quaint traces of rude manners
with the grandeur of the church, the
magnificence of the days of great
kings—it only added zest to the living
rush of the streets, the foreign faces
and unaccustomed accents, the endless
variety of movement that shone, flickered,
or darkened every way about them.
Then, slowly extricated from fetid
lanes and old overhanging houses,
patched, and stained, and ruinous,
where the low-stretched cord of the
street lantern showed that carriages
seldom passed, they would wheel out
suddenly from the rough causeway
and its filthy middle-gutter, into the
broad light and sunny air of the verdurous
boulevards, where the ramparts
of old Paris ran. So as the sounds
of wheels grew soft, and they rolled
leisurely along, the girl and her
brother would look to each other, with
something of the same feeling; her eyes
would sparkle, while Charles’s were
everywhere: when on either side of
the curving vista, either way lost to
sight, and heaped with the motion of
equipages and riders, the showering
elm-leaves and blossoming lime-twigs
rose green ’gainst the tall, bright,
ornate houses, tinted variously, and
dappled fitfully by the shade—where
the scattered passengers lounged, the
loitering groups mingled, and all was
open-air existence—while the gay
shop-windows and café signs shone
beneath the boughs, the open upper-casements
seemed to drink coolness
beneath their striped canopies through
green-barred jalousies, the double shutter-frames
were thrown out either way
against the wall, and no care, no business
appeared to hang on Paris far
as eye could reach, as it thickened
there through the swimming light of
afternoon. To Rose and Charles it
left no dissatisfactions about Stoke,
nor regret for the smoke of London;
and instead of wishing the place of
their residence settled soon, although
neither had confided it to the other,
they would fain, no doubt, have had
their father decide on staying where
they were, so as to fulfil the suggestion
of the worthy concierge, by making
acquaintances and going into society.
The truth was, that they were unconsciously
somewhat conspicuous; whether
it was that the full, fair, lady-like
features of Lady Willoughby, with her
hair aristocratically enough drawn up,
heaped high, and powdered, had yet
an air of half-sleepy ease and comfort
that offered the strongest contrast to
French looks, or that the hood-like
bonnet of black crape which surmounted
them, drawn in folds together and
hung with its short curtain-like veil of
black lace, however according to matronly
usage then in London, had already
been left behind in Paris by a
barer and more classical taste; or the
girlish grace and bloom of Rose in her
mourning-dress and hat; the half clerical
air of Mr Thorpe, with his mingled
awkwardness and endeavours at attention
to the ladies; or the military air,
tall figure, and splendid English hunter
of the baronet: all which, perhaps,
taken together, might even in passing
have suggested food for the proverbial
Parisian curiosity. Especially if,
as at times might have been done,
they had noticed the grave silence of
the elderly English gentleman on
horseback, when his companion addressed
him in vain, or when with a
start he looked up to answer, sometimes
running his eye keenly about
the passing people, over the seated
and trifling groups, up to the windows
of the houses, or along the shop-signs,
like one all at once awake to them.
Indeed, out of the charmingly private
<i><span lang="fr">allée des veuves</span></i> in the Elysian fields,
where alone the equipages of the rich
widows of the whole capital were in
propriety seen to drive, and the doubtful
widowers and needy bachelors to
seek opportunities of consoling them,
with a similar gravity of dress and demeanour—it
was questionable whether
the people of Paris were accustomed
to observe so puzzlingly attractive a
sight. It had altogether, no doubt,
a sincere insular air in their eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>It happened that on the day they had
visited Notre Dame cathedral, Colonel
Willoughby took advantage of their
return through the Rue St Honoré to
call at his banker’s in that leading
street. He had transacted his principal
business there, and only found
some difficulty in detaching himself
from the subsequent animated conversation
of the courteous financier,
whose spirits seemed to be excellent
on account of some continued increase
in the price of corn; a motive but
dimly understood by Sir Godfrey,
while at each step or two of his
egress from the antechamber he was
still detained by some fresh ground of
satisfaction. As regarded places of
abode to be had, in any part of France
whatever, the perplexity did not certainly
result from want of choice; since
his last inquiry, the notices and advertisements
had increased, particularly
in the rural provinces; to be let or
sold, they seemed surprisingly plentiful;
nor were their advantages in every
point omitted, after the usual style of
such description, which sometimes dilated
on the very nature of the landscape,
or dwelt with gusto on the particular
character of architecture. “It
is doubtless owing, Monsieur le Baron,”
suggested the banker, complacently,
“to the immense resort, at the present,
of the nobility to Paris. The attraction
is excessive! It will indeed be
impossible to reside but in the vicinity—and
M. le Baron sympathises,
I imagine, with the party of
our ——, probably to a certain extent
in the ——?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I really know very little of political
matters, Monsieur,” said the
baronet, smiling, “even at home,—and
as for those in this country, I can
scarcely say that I have attended to
them much.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is exactly the position which I
have myself assumed, M. le Baron,”
responded the banker, with a subdued
air of confidential understanding. “In
finance it is indispensable. But affairs
are solid here;” and he gaily struck
his hand on his pocket. “Things will
move—they will go—now that M.
Neckar is at the head! M. le Baron
is doubtless aware that the meetings
of the States-General have commenced,
and are open to attendance, like
the English parliament itself? Bah
we are aware that in affairs nowadays,
the minister is everything; to
speak properly—the king, nothing!
The discussions grow interesting—it
was a happy stroke—to render the
nation—yes, conceive, Monsieur,—responsible
for its own expenses!
And, after all, the world is governed
by this money here!” Sir Godfrey
sighed involuntarily, while the banker,
slightly rubbing his hands together,
bowing and smiling, still conducted
him with <em>empressement</em> towards the
court in which his horse was held.
“It would be easy to secure a distinguished
place of audience for M. le
Baron in the minister’s gallery at Versailles,”
persisted Monsieur Blaise,
with interest, “and for the family of
M. le Baron, whom we have not
yet, indeed, had the honour to see?”
M. Blaise had, in fact, made sundry
half-subdued advances, at various
times, towards a mutual introduction
of the families; which seemed latterly
to become more obvious. “Thank
you, Monsieur,” was the rather dry
answer—“no. The fact is, we intend
immediately leaving town, as
soon as my eldest son arrives. And,
of course, this matter as to a place of
residence must be settled. I should
prefer some remote, quiet, country
place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, you should then purchase, M.
de Vilby,” said the banker, oracularly.
“It is, on the whole, I assure you,
cheaper—more satisfactory.” To this,
however, he received a decided negative;
Colonel Willoughby had as
little interest in the idea presented to
him by Monsieur Blaise, of a profitable
re-sale at a future period, as of
possessing property or forming permanent
ties in France, or of leaving
his son a landowner there. He was
about to mount his horse amidst the
attentions of the banker and his Swiss
porter, when a depressed-looking
clerk from the banking-office hastened
out, with an air of some timidity, to
offer a paper to his master. The latter
frowned, while he received a hurried
statement from the official. “What
is this? not to be found!” he inquired.
“It is a trifle, Monsieur,” added he,
turning round; “the woman, it seems,
to whom your communication referred,
has for some time removed her residence.
Inquiries shall be made, however.
These poor people are of the
most changeable habit—the notary of
the proprietor is naturally ignorant of
their new destination—the neighbours,
they affect an unconsciousness which is
probably feigned, on account of some
sympathy with a fault, a defalcation
in rent,—a crime, perhaps. But
in this case, there is the police, under
whom the emigrant necessarily falls,
though unconsciously—and our police
are now more efficient than ever. Yes,
M. le Baron, this person shall be
promptly discovered, believe me—if,
indeed, this payment is still considered
proper to be made?” The indifferent,
languidly commercial tone of
Monsieur Blaise, at that moment,
jarred disagreeably on Sir Godfrey’s
ear, in the full sunlight of the street,
while its gay throng poured on either
way like a twofold procession.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yet there is a slight mistake,
pardon me, Monsieur,” added the
former, “in the understanding that
Monsieur your brother had continued
this pension, which is alluded to,
during the late years. It was indeed
paid with regularity, when transmitted;
but although the promise remained
subsequently, yet, after a certain
point, by some omission, doubtless, the
effects—the sums—ceased to arrive.
I believe the inadvertency was, however,
more than once reported from
this office to the notary of M. de Vilby
at Ezzeterre, in England—eh, Maître
Robert?” And the clerk, to whom
he again turned sharply, gave a reverential
affirmative. It was not
merely the revival of this trivial
matter in this way that troubled Sir
Godfrey; there was some slight concern
stirred at his heart by the discovery
of the slight sum having failed
so long to reach its object, mixed
with a little compunction at his remembrance
of the crowded Cité, near
the religious shadows of Notre Dame,
which he had passed by that very
day; there was a vivid feeling once
more, too, of his brother’s characteristic
carelessness, which was by no
means lessened on recollecting his
wife’s mild remark, when he had mentioned
the circumstance, that possibly,
if the person were very poor,
it might have been better to see into
it personally. The gross mingling of
M. Blaise’s inquiries in it, besides,
with his hint at crimes which might
render the benefit undeserved, annoyed
him. Sir Godfrey took the paper
from the banker’s hands, expressed
his intention of managing the matter
at his own leisure, and with a hasty
bow rode homewards.</p>

<p class='c009'>Willoughby was, as before said, a
man with little imagination in his
temperament, at least of no very lively
fancy; but there was a kind of vague
impatience at times in his mind,
scarcely to be any better accounted for
than the fits of gloom he felt creeping,
as it were, over him, and which he
checked only by a strong effort to
think. Sir Godfrey felt, in fact, rather an
indescribable satisfaction than otherwise,
and a somewhat reviving interest,
at the little matter of business that
had returned on his hands, none the less
that it took the aspect of a kind duty.
Paris itself was certainly a degree
nearer his attention, so soon as the
concerns of any one in it, however
obscure, were thus dependent on his
own, stirring up an odd anxiety as to
whether she were alive or dead, and
really deserving; all which, the more
unusual it was to his habits, bore with
the greater novelty of sensation on a
man whose ordinary habits had been
somewhat abruptly broken up. Singular,
indeed, as he rode along, grew
the thought of how this vast city contrived
to live from day to day? the
question, yet more perplexing, how it
spent its time? still less conceivable,
to what end was all the constant
movement, thickening and shifting far
along the Rue St Honoré, in dust and
sunlight? Nay, with a smiling sense
of its absurdity, the baronet caught
himself involuntarily pondering some
such incalculable problem, and for a
moment striving to put its organisation
together, while the bridle lay
slack on his horse’s neck, and his
limbs kept time to the motion, as the
noble black went stepping elastically
on. Even in that fashionable street
they excited notice amid its rattling
cortège of equestrians and equipages,
its rainbow quivering of dress, feathered,
embroidered, gilded and laced
and rustling, where all the artifice of
French fashion was in its afternoon
glory, with bell-hoop and white hair—from
the queue-tag and three-cornered
beaver, lace cravat, and ruffles, and
pocket-flap, to the knee-buckles and
the false calves, white or flesh-coloured,
and high-heeled—treading on out-turned
toes—while the smooth, tinted
faces, with their mole-specks and
black beauty-spots, seemed to have
banished from about them, in the
sun’s full influence, all effect of hair:
though it was scarce so much the
soberly-garbed rider, in dark riding-coat
and boots, with military stock,
as the jet gloss of Black Rupert,
whose full nostril seemed half conscious
of his master’s pride in him.
Nor was it merely that the flickering
blaze of the street disagreed with his
mood, when Colonel Willoughby
turned out of it through a quieter line
of that gay fauxbourg, slightly using
the spur: he shrank involuntarily
from those of his countrymen who
seemed to be in Paris, with their
gregarious yet unsocial air, their loud
voices, causeless laughter, and cool
stare, their ill-affected ease of dress,
their round morning hats at all hours,
and their sudden knowing looks of
interest from his horse to him, not
seldom unaccompanied by distinct
English questions of “Who is he?”
or the drawling answer, with an eyeglass
raised, of “Don’t know.” Yet
in public places they were everywhere;
they were looking out of
corner cafés, and talking back to
friends within, watching narrowly
where some Parisian belle tripped
carefully athwart a crossing, or leaning
out of billiard-room second-floors
and yawning; and it struck him the
more in contrast, as two gentlemen,
evidently French, turned before him
into the same more secluded street,
the one quietly shrugging his shoulders
together, the other turning a silent
look to his friend. They sauntered
easily along on the sunny side of the
gutter, as if delaying to cross; though
side <em>trottoirs</em> were as yet almost unknown,
while the cry of <i><span lang="fr">gare!</span></i> from a
rapid vehicle at times hurried the foot-passengers
together towards the wall,
or out amidst the causeway; so that a
snatch of their conversation more than
once reached the English baronet’s
ears, or was mingled with other
voices; as he looked round for the
names of the streets, with some idea
of at once beginning inquiries at the
nearest police-office. “These, then,
Jules,” said the taller and elder, who
wore the gallant uniform of the Royal
Body-Guard, sky-azure and gold-laced,
with its white-plumed black hat,
crimson-velvet breeches, stiff cavalry
boots, and gilt spurs, and ruffles of rich
lace—“are your allies—your Weegs,
as you call them! Corbleu!” He
looked back over one shoulder, as he
spoke, with a supremely supercilious
air, swinging the tassel of his sword-knot
round his hand; the other, whose
dress and manner were those of an
elegant young man of fashion, seemed
gently to draw him onward by the
arm. “My dear Armand, what a
fancy!” the latter ejaculated; “the
generous sympathy of the enlightened
English—of the descendants of Hampdeun
and of Seednè, the Wheegs—but
I forget, we agreed to——” “Yes,
Comte,” said the other gloomily, “we
agreed to observe silence on it, since
it is impossible for us——” and by
another influx from a cross street they
were taken out of hearing; although
the grave air of the young officer,
enhanced by his long side-visage, and
cavalier-like uniform, despite all the
hair-powder and the smooth elaborateness
of the time, had drawn Sir
Godfrey’s interest from the matter he
had in hand. They were walking near
him again next minute.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is at La Morgue, then?”
asked the officer, in reference to some
statement of his friend; “what was
it—gambling? His mistress, perhaps?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, she was beautiful, and attached
to him,” replied the other,
carelessly; “she still slept, while he
had left her, to shave in the adjacent
dressing-room—the whole hotel was
roused by her cries. The police can
make nothing of it. Even his passport
affords no clue.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was probably a plot, about
to be discovered,” said his friend.
“Paris, in my opinion, is full of plots—which
had better soon be dashed to
pieces.” He made an emphatic motion
with the sheathed sabre on his
left arm, and glanced firmly along the
street, from face to face. “My dear
Armand!” ejaculated the other, stopping
for an instant till their eyes met,
and the cheek of the garde-du-corps
seemed to redden—“this is”—but the
remainder was lost to Sir Godfrey, as
he held round towards the outskirts
of the Faubourg St Honoré. Crossing
by a shorter way, however, they still
preceded him at the next corner.
“On the contrary,” continued the
younger, “had there been anything
to discover”—“—stupidly acute as
the police are”—“—but believe me,
my friend,” he added with animation,
“there was nothing—nothing—it was
merely <em>ennui</em>. And what police,
were it the very espionage of old De
Sartines himself, his apprentice and
friend Lenoir, or even my fine cousin
De Breteuil, with your thrice-humble
servitor here, can guard against ennui?
’Tis the only spectre I dread, for the
philosophers, the Encyclopédie, have
still left it us!” Sir Godfrey had
passed them, indeed, hardly heeding
their detached words so much as the
young soldier’s chivalrous air; a little
on, he checked his horse at sight of a
gendarme’s blue and red livery, to
inquire for the police-bureau of the
quarter; at which the man turned
sharply, struck no doubt by the accent
or the form of the question, and surveyed
him before attempting to give
an answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ennui!” repeated the officer energetically,
as they came on; “my faith,
we shall soon have little enough of
that luxury, I think! I had imagined
it the disease of England!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But without her suspecting it,”
rejoined his livelier companion; “while
France alone endeavours to expel, to
define the malady! What is Versailles,
Fontainebleau, Marly, Luciennes,
but a vast sigh, a drowsy
effort, a yawn (<i><span lang="fr">baillement</span></i>)? Those
parterres of Lenotre, those fountains,
those statues, which are like the
crimes of Paris! But we awake—and
assure yourself, my friend, it is
at the root of one half—”</p>

<p class='c009'>Colonel Willoughby had repeated
his question rather impatiently, for
the speaker, as he passed on, was
turning a glance of attention that
way: the gendarme, too, with a sudden
motion of his hand to his huge
cocked hat, seemed less careful to
reply than to leave full room for the
two gentlemen. The younger of
them stopped, turned, and addressed
a word of sharp reproof to the official.
“Permit me, monsieur,” he added,
coming forward with a slight bow,
and speaking tolerably good English;
“it is probably rather to the commissary
of your quarter you would address
yourself, and his residence is not far;
at —— the number which I forget,
in the Place Montaigne, Champs
Elysées.” The Englishman thanked
him briefly; bowing in return the
more profoundly, as he felt the usual
unwillingness of his race to receive a
favour he had no claim to.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is denoted, besides,” continued
his informant with increased courtesy,
“by the red lantern over the portico,
which since two years has been fixed
over the doorway of every commissary’s
residence in Paris. Day or
night this will serve to distinguish
them by a glance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed?” was the sole answer, in
a tone of some indifference. There
was nothing officious in the younger
gentleman’s unasked interference;
while his singularly handsome face,
his vivacious eyes, the air of life in
his expression, along with an undeniable
elegance of manner, were contrasted
for the first time with his
elder companion, who stood apart,
and almost haughtily silent, a dark
shade seeming to gather on his thin
and dusky cheek, as he gazed into the
street, having even withdrawn his
momentary notice of the spirited
horse. Yet the baronet felt less
annoyed thus than by the prolonged
politeness of his friend; he involuntarily
bit his lip; there was something
disagreeable even in being so
promptly addressed in his own language.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Might it be possible for one to
assist monsieur in any yet further
manner?” inquired the stranger, with
the same easy grace; though a
peculiar smile, at the time unintelligible
to Sir Godfrey, had hovered
about his lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My best thanks, monsieur,” was
the stiff response. “I think not—it
is a mere ordinary piece of business;”
and, bowing deeply towards his horse’s
shoulder, the English baronet turned
in the direction indicated. He could
see them from the distance, however,
overtaken by a light cabriolet, which
seemed to have been slowly following
them all the while; the young <i><span lang="fr">élégant</span></i>
stepped leisurely in, and with a gesture
of adieu to his friend, was driven
swiftly off towards the city again; the
white plume of the garde-du-corps
disappeared among the passengers.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Sir Godfrey had found the
commissary’s office, shown the indispensable
passport, and received, as he
had expected, but little prospect of
speedy information, he yet rode homewards
in considerable ease of mind;
the thing had in fact passed from his
thoughts as he took the nearer way
from the grand avenues of the Champs
Elysées, thronging with gaiety, by
the overhanging shade of garden walls
and backs of stables, across the open
spaces flushed green with the afternoon
light, alive with strolling girls
in their teens, beside their prim <em>gouvernantes</em>,
or children scattered about
the groups of their sitting, gossipping,
sewing <em>bonnes</em>; while here and there,
into a line of secluded street, full of
tall, stately, old-fashioned houses in
massy blocks, or separate in their
high-walled court-yards, sloped lazily
the white, gushing glory from far
above; till the way towards a bridge,
or some glimpse of the bustle about
the airy quays, renewed again the
sense of being in Paris. But it seemed
as if some of its occurrences, otherwise
as apparently fragmentary as the
street-cries or confused accents, bore
every now and then a more connected
purport to the baronet as he came in
contact with them.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had already thrown a coin or
two mechanically to some squalid
cripple, or some one-eyed beggar in
his route, thinking no more of it; as
he turned into the thoroughfare near
home, however, out of one of these
sun-bright and silent streets, where a
few figures crossed here and there, a
singular little incident presented itself,
which was but part of many such
scenes throughout the quieter quarters
of the French capital. It was one of
the strangest symptoms of that strange
time, that while the king had been
suppressing dungeons and projecting
the good of the people, while the
nobles desired reform of abuses, and
the whole nation seemed to breathe
peace, philanthropy, and enthusiasm—the
very fashion of the salons had
conceived a sudden sensibility to the
miseries and wants of the lowest class.
The late winters had been severe, and
the last desperate, amidst dear provisions:
there had been fêtes, lotteries,
and performances of classic dramas
in the theatre, although for these last
the curés had refused to distribute their
unhallowed proceeds: yet greatest of
all had been the activity of the ladies in
the genteel faubourgs, who, in graceful
<i><span lang="fr">toilettes de quête</span></i>, the most becoming
of dresses, and with purses bearing
embroideries of flowers, cupids, and
touching mottoes, turned their morning
calls into a quest for alms. In
the less aristocratic quarters, where
morning calls were scarcely made, it
had taken hold chiefly on the little
girls, from mere childhood up to their
teens; lasting longer, doubtless, because
exercised only in the open air
on the street-passengers, with all the
amusement of a play mingled in its
touch of reality. How interesting
was it, too, to the subjects of the
performance, as they were chosen from
the passing current with all that
faculty of prompt organisation so peculiar
to the race of France; for the
<em>rendezvous</em> was made in the neighbouring
archway of some porte-cochère,
apart from the bustle of the
crowd, to hold the table with its
white fringed cloth, and the silver
salver, where the savings of their own
pocket-money had been first put for
a handsel, as they gathered from the
various houses near. The old gentleman,
as he approached, had his skirts
pulled by some lisping little one, with
chubby cheeks, and curls that had
vainly been flattened, while her face
peered from under the grey stuff of
the mimic beggar’s cloak: the most
simply dressed would hold the salver
to the lady of quality; the most polite
to the bourgeois; the plainest-featured
to the widow, the spinster, or faded
beauty; the tallest to the middle-aged
gentleman, the prettiest to the gallant:
and no rivalry, but how to get most,
disturbed the co-operation of those
young quêteuses. The English baronet,
indeed, knew nothing of it as he
trotted forward, before the archway
could be seen, with its lurking, listening,
peeping group, holding their
breath in expectation: he only saw a
slender young form, too tall for the
grey cloak to smother the whole of her
white summer dress, trip from beside
the wall, and hold up her rosy palm
before him, like a beggar; they had
chosen the eldest, for her eyes and complexion,
to try the rich Englishman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pour nos pauvres, s’il vous plait,
Monsieur,” said a clear sweet voice,
plaintively. Sir Godfrey had checked
his horse with a start; she was a girl
little younger than his own Rose, with
the very blue eyes and that palest yellow
hair, which are so rare in France,
though with that warmly-bright complexion
which is never seen out of it,
suffused as it seems through a strange
shadow of brown. The folds and hood
of the cloak could not disguise the
girlish grace of her figure, just shooting
towards womanhood; the studiously
plain arrangement of the hair
<i><span lang="fr">à la quête</span></i>, virgin-like, added to her
pure beauty, and did not take away
from the slightly coquettish glance
from her drooped head as she thus
made her appeal. “My dear little
one!” ejaculated Sir Godfrey hastily—“how—what—<em>you</em>
are not a—in
poverty?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her cheek reddened as she drew up
her head proudly. “Me? Yes, we
are poor, but noble—Armand and I.
It is for the poor of the city, Monsieur—of
Paris.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sir Godfrey reddened too, and listened
calmly to her eager explanation.
“Ah, <em>you</em> are rich—you are
English!” she added anxiously, as if
afraid he hesitated. His glance of
surprised inquiry did not escape her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know you, Monsieur,” she said,
“for you live close to our convent in
the Rue Debilly, near the Quai de
Change, where I am a pensionnaire,
and where my aunt is the superior.
I come often with one of the sisters
to arrange the quête here. There are
so many poor!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And to whom do you give this
money, <i><span lang="fr">belle petite</span></i>?” asked the baronet,
smiling at her delighted thanks
for the gold he placed in her hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To the curés and their vicars,
Monsieur,” she said gravely, “who
will distribute it—they know every
one so well!” Sir Godfrey mused.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you live near us!” he said,
thinking of his own daughter, as he
asked her name.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is Aimée—and my brother
is Armand de l’Orme, an officer at
Versailles. We are orphans, Armand
and I, and we do not belong
to Paris. We were both born in the
south, in Provence—Were you ever
in Provence, Monsieur—ah, how much
more beautiful it is!” With an air of
empressement she clasped her hands,
and standing there in the quietly
sunny street, while the stream of the
populous chaussée passed athwart its
end, the girl seemed to forget her impatient
company beyond, whose whispers
and exclamations at last betrayed
them to the surprised glance of Sir
Godfrey. “Was she allowed,” he
asked, however, “to make visits from
her convent—for <em>he</em> had a daughter,
little older than herself, who had no
companions of her own age in Paris.”
And the young quêteuse responded
eagerly to the hint. “Oh, yes—she
was allowed—on certain days—and
she would positively come. Indeed—perhaps—mademoiselle
herself would
assist at their quête.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The baronet shook his head, almost
starting in his saddle at the thought.
But it struck him suddenly that
his oddly-made new acquaintance,
through her friends the curés, might
aid him in discovery of the missing
Suzanne Deroux; and she was all
readiness and sanguine expectation
when he explained the matter.
There was one young vicar in particular,
so mild, so missionnaire, so apostolique,
whose acquaintance with all
the poorer quarters was miraculous:
she would be able to bring the news,
she was sure, very soon indeed. So
giving her, at her request, the same
paper he had recalled from his banker,
Sir Godfrey saw her rejoin her archway
amidst the impatient welcome of
her companions, and took his way
into the Rue Debilly, with a feeling
half-amused, half-meditative.</p>

<p class='c009'>At home, there were fresh letters
and newspapers awaiting him, with
the dinner-time, unwontedly late.
There had been already the expected
tidings from Francis to his mother,
though brief, that he was finally free
of term-times, having reached London,
which he was ready to leave next
week; his father’s remaining business
there seemed fully settled, but he was
to dine, before starting, at their friend
the solicitor’s, and bring over with
him everything wanted. He enclosed
his sister’s letter, however, from her
dearest school-fellow, crossed and recrossed,
with all its precious gossip
for common use, its inexpressible sentiments
that were not to be seen by
another creature, and its postscript
with the sole piece of real, intelligible
information. Mrs Mason’s correspondence
also, whose contents had at
no time been breathed to any one, had
been forwarded: while Sir Godfrey
himself had a packet from Mr Hesketh’s
office in Exeter, giving on the
whole satisfactory prospects, and containing
a few papers from among the
late Sir John’s dreary mass of lumber;
hitherto overlooked, but which he
might care to examine. They were
for the most part unimportant, but he
saw, from the first glance at one of
them, that had it arrived that morning,
it might have simply saved him a
little trouble and uncertainty; as it
was a French letter of date not long
before his brother’s death, evidently
written by some humble notary’s
clerk, to state the case of the Suzanne
in question, who had received a pension
for an injury received while
in his service, probably interrupted
through the change of abode by her
children, whose work supported them;
but her son had been ill, and the winter
severe; the application had been
rather made at the penman’s instance,
as he lived <i><span lang="fr">au quatrième</span></i> in the house
where their attic was, and had himself
discovered the address by going
to the banker’s, where he had obtained
no other prospect. It stated the place
and number distinctly, and had in all
likelihood led to the memorandum of
Sir John,—though no doubt thrown
aside at the moment, and with his
confused mind in those latter days, so
busy amidst out-door matters or convivial
meetings, its chief point had
been forgotten.</p>

<p class='c009'>Joining in the eager table-talk it
had all excited, with a mind at rest,
the baronet could fully share the pleasure
of home-thoughts: the very atmosphere
of the room seemed English,
for all its bare waxed floor and patch
of carpet, its airy paper-hangings of
pastoral scenes, its light curtains and
tall glaring windows with flimsy
frames, its stove-filled chimney-place,
and the white folding-doors of its
antechamber, about all which there
lurked no corner of substantial comfort,
as round the wainscot and panelling,
the recesses and embayments,
corner-cupboards, and hearth-places,
and presses of home, with its high-backed
arm-chair, noiseless floors, and
family pictures: the sound of the convent-bell,
and Sir Godfrey’s account
of his pretty little <i><span lang="fr">quêteuse</span></i>, alone
brought back their recollection. It
had been long since Lady Willoughby
saw her husband so cheerful, even
when he turned to his newspaper, and
sat absorbed in its varied matter,
leaning back on that hard diminutive
sofa;—Mrs Mason, as her custom was,
has withdrawn to the mysterious privacy
of her own apartment; Mr
Thorpe, to a book, apart in the wide
naked antechamber; while at its further
windows, looking out, sit the two
young people in their unwearied charge
of the street;—till, as that after-dinner
repose steals through the sitting-room,
with cool shade from the early May
twilight, she feels instinctively that
his old easy habit of middle age has
returned on him, the first time since
reaching France—nay, on second
thought, since the day of that melancholy
message from Devonshire—of
sinking at that hour into a doze. It
scarce needs her turning her head, to
see how the affairs and concerns of the
world at large have fallen from his
mind; while gently netting on, without
word or other motion, perhaps
with no particular thought besides,
she sits quiet that it may last the
longer. It had seemed vague, in its
connection with a trifle; but neither
she nor he could have told the indescribable
relief it had given him to find
the only singularity in Sir John’s memoranda
cleared up; in this commonplace
way, too, when even casual circumstances
had seemed joining to
give it a feverish importance. That
intended but ineffectual will of his, by
which he had evidently contemplated
a formal bequest, with those slight
exceptions, of everything to the colonel,
already his legal heir, could
after all have had no rational motive;
it was probably but one of those
strangely groundless suspicions, those
longings to exercise influence from
the very tomb, which cross an unsound
mind. The colonel had not
been unconscious of the superior abilities
of his eldest brother, nor of the
still brighter parts which were attributed
to his brother John in early
life; he only felt reassured by the
conviction, again confirmed, that the
unhappy results of his foolish match
had been such as to touch his brain
with insanity. There was a vulgar
old story about their family, in fact—a
sort of absurd country superstition—that
owing to some ancient ancestral
impiety, even when the ghost
ceased to be heard of in the long portrait-gallery
at Stoke, over the great
staircase—which had been invisible to
the family alone—then somewhere or
other a Willoughby was mad. Often
had the colonel smiled at it, when
merely a younger brother in the army;
a wound once received in his head in
America, which had cost him delirious
days and nights, seemed formerly
to entitle him doubly to his smile at
the corroboration, when restored to
full health: nay, from some cause, he
had found himself thinking of it once
or twice in the full blaze of the streets
of Paris, with their vivid reminiscences—though
his smile had been but
faint, now he was the younger brother
no longer. For <em>why</em>, really, after all,
had he come to Paris in particular,
or lingered there, persuading himself
under so many different forms about
its convenience, the novelty to his
children, the advantage of his brother’s
banker, the little legacy, the
comparative privacy, the rapid post,
or the many notices of places to let?
Why, in that indirect way, had he
sought to make inquiries of the police,
and caught himself listening to words
in the street, of unknown suicides,
baffled investigations, and French
ennui? Why had he mechanically
shrunk from the Boulevards and rushing
St Honoré, yet glanced askance
at windows full of faces, or looked
again with an irresistible suspicion, to
see if he recognised or was recognised
by any one—not merely on that day,
but on previous ones also? Actually,
in the hot, beating sun, it had for a
moment or two resembled the preface
to his fever in the colonies, after that
affair with their rabble of militia,
among whom he had fancied he saw a
known visage disguised; and the strong
effort of his understanding which recovered
him had only brought more
keenly the sudden question—whether
his brother indeed, or he himself, had
been touched with the germs of a growing
madness. There had been strange
horror in the thought. For, had
there really been a deliberate, sober
meaning in his brother’s stray purposes,
through the confusion of all his
neglect, and though cut off by death?
While the quick, clear self-suspicion
had seemed to pierce his own mind
with shame, how, amidst an uneasiness
to associate with his countrymen, he
was still traversing Paris everywhere,
under cover of guidance to his family,
mingling private anxieties with the
grandeur of royal edifices, and continuing
to expect some chance vestige
of things which his brother might have
chosen wisely to leave in silence. Since
his succession to Stoke he must have
been altering insensibly. Even selfish
feelings, impatient wishes, hidden
thoughts, or half-fretful expressions
towards her who had been so long his
solace, had then recurred to mind with
a painful surprise; compared with
which, his brother’s eccentricity appeared
innocent indeed, sadly as his
earlier follies had brought it on. And
had he heard before from Mr Hesketh
what he learned from the letter on his
return, that the manor-house and park
were unlikely to be soon let, or to
bring any profitable addition to the
rents at present, from a fresh and
growing rumour that they were haunted,
it would have startled him with a
superstitious feeling far more oppressive
than any at Stoke. But, as it
was, with a sober return to accustomed
thoughts, calmed by his unwonted
self-scrutiny, for him so deep—and
soothed by gentle presence—Sir Godfrey
slipped from his practical, matter-of-fact
English newspaper to repose;
though with the melancholy conviction
that his brother’s understanding had
indeed partially given way. They had
not latterly seen very much of each
other: John was now at peace; his
fruitless life had come to an end. The
baronet was awoke only by the rustling
entrance of Mrs Mason to pour
out the chocolate—Mr Thorpe’s awkward
haste to set her chair—the bringing
in of wax-lights—the pause before
grace was said, with the tutor’s devout
formality. The evening talk was
as duly closed by Mr Thorpe’s reading
of the appointed prayers—another
advantage never gained by Lady Willoughby
till their departure abroad
required a tutor.</p>

<p class='c009'>As if there were not strange noises
dying far and wide through the city,
till across the river could be heard the
great clock of the Invalides. As if
the atmosphere of the world were not
at that hour infected with inscrutable
sympathies and mysterious desires;
which gathered in Paris, as after long
heat that malady of the air, felt keenly
by the lower creatures: so that it
might have been working vaguely
even with Sir Godfrey. And as if,
though clouded and stagnant, even
well-nigh lost, the judgment of the
departed might not have exercised
some acute thought—deeper even
than the sharpest lawyer could track
it.</p>

<p class='c009'>So quiet, after prayers, was the outer
night over the bare roofs, and lights,
and distant pinnacles of the city—the
glimpse of the river, the lamps on the
bridge, the trees of the Champ de
Mars—and so wide with its floating
films of fair May-cloud, softening the
few stars—that Rose Willoughby
shaded her candle to peep out at it,
lifting the blind, and putting her face
close to the window-glass, after she had
said her prayers, and was half ready
to go to bed. Listening to Mrs
Mason’s steps in the next room, extinguisher
in hand, lest her door should
suddenly be opened to that lady’s
most indignant surprise—Rose thought
still of to-morrow’s drive toward
Versailles.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pleasant was it, on that bright hot
morning, to escape at last from Paris
altogether. Sir Godfrey, indeed, remained
at home to write his letters,
with the purpose of riding out to meet
them on their return: and Mr Thorpe,
on horseback, with charge of the magic
passports, was the sole cavalier;
shrewdly overseen, doubtless, by the
hard-eyed, rough-visaged, experienced
Jackson, to whose sturdy driving there
lay no perplexity about those great,
straight, formal French roads, with
staring guide-posts and swarms of
Parisian people.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon, in fact, does the grand road
towards Versailles sweep away from
sight of Paris in its wide basin, among
avenues and closing woods. With no
lanes, nor secluded cross-ways, save
to towns, it was harder to leave behind
the Parisian people; and they
soon heard that Versailles was stripped
of its glory, so far as they were
concerned, since nothing was doing
there that day; the king had gone to
Marly, or Fontainebleau, instead of
passing in state to the Assembly, as
had been expected from the journals.
Much to the relief, it must have been,
of Lady Willoughby, who disliked
crowds and pressures of people, with
the bustle and the dust; and to whom
foreign kings and queens had but a
dim, half-chimerical reality, after
all, compared with the accustomed
Georges, whose power and royalty
were interwoven with any thoughts
she had of public life; yet she appeared
as much vexed as it was possible
for her to be, proposing still to go on
and see the outside of the palace, the
fountains, or the remaining courtiers,
the “houses of parliament,” which
perhaps might be worth the pains. But
these Charles disdained till another
day, when the king should have returned—being
even set against the
remotest view of the town, its very
smoke or spires; and, out of his
father’s presence, Charles was always,
by some peculiar force of his, indirectly
master. His sister Rose, though the
expedition had been fondly planned,
nor did his arguments seem worth answering,
too well knew the issue not
to be resigned; while her governess,
referred to as a matter of course, expressed
as duly an entire acquiescence
in any arrangement most satisfactory
to Lady Willoughby, preserving an
intense calm, and seeming to observe
the various objects as their course was
changed, the leaves of the trees, the
tops of palisades, the very hats of
market-people, with strange elevation
of countenance, and with an air of
suffering which required her vinaigrette.
Even Jackson, who had a
great share of the selfishness of privileged
old servants, and greatly consulted
his own personal ease, ventured to
console his mistress, turning round
and touching his hat, to remark that
it was a long drive after all, and they
would have had to put up at the town
to bait these Flanders beasts—he carefully
abstained from calling them horses—<em>which</em>
it might cost a deal of trouble,
as these French inns very likely had
no stables; the inward satisfaction of
Jackson, indeed, somewhat belied his
rueful effort to look grieved. All appeared
disappointed, save the tutor,
ever fain to be serviceable, if seldom
very successful where the office was
of the present kind. Yet that day Mr
Thorpe was excelling himself, now
riding on, or now remaining behind,
always for some object; nor was it
long ere he came posting back, his
plain, ineffectual features animated,
and his mild short-sighted blue eyes
shining moist through the thin-framed
spectacles which enlarged them, to
mention that they were close to Sèvres,
where the royal porcelain was made.
And at Sèvres, with its quaint old village
houses, and its bridge across the
Seine to another village, seeing what
could be seen of its manufactory, its
water-mill where the clay was ground,
or its woody island amidst the river,
the earlier part of the day was spent.
Then turning to make a wide circuit
into the Versailles road again, where
the afternoon was to bring Sir Godfrey,
the carriage passed at leisure
through the quieter country that slopes
and rolls westward from the Seine.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was scarce country, indeed, where
no hedgerows seemed to break up the
wide spaces, no field-gates or clustered
farms, nor half-sequestered hamlets,
with the sprinkling on of solitary cottage
and quiet house toward the next,
where the church spire should rise, or
tower; but sometimes with no division
from the wide crops, save the lines of
bushy pollards, they rolled over the
paved roadway; again between continual
park walls or wooden palisade,
from which suddenly it would burst
on the space about a large square village,
with its cabaret and sign-board
of the <i><span lang="fr">Lion d’or</span></i> or <i><span lang="fr">d’argent</span></i>, its old
fountain-well, and double row of trees,
noisy, and alive with children, while
another road brought through it the
market-life from Paris. Though over
the nearest wood would peep the white
turrets of chateaus, peaked with purple
slate, or tin, or gilding, like chandeliers
extinguished in the light of day; and
near to them were the little stunted
churches, with their rounded ends, the
squat towers that had lids to them like
pots and vases, or the mean belfries
perched on the roofs; where the church-yard
was blooming with flowers that
made its cypresses and yews look
gloomier, and the small lonely curacy
near it, snowing the cross on some wide
gable, had an air of pious seclusion from
the world. And still the parks spread
round; the woods, with formal alleys
striking through them, widened and
surged outward, downward, into vale
and over height; sometimes opening
to let the high road pass on with its
vehicles and pedestrians, or the traffic
that seemed greater for its confinement,—oftener
to show the terraces
and bowers of still nobler mansions
than before, till the country appeared
fading away.  They had forgotten
their forenoon disappointment: the
girl’s eyes sparkled as the sweet sense
of being out of Paris grew, in spite of
all it held in it; placid, tranquil, her
mother leant opposite, while she
breathed the freshness, enjoying the
mere motion, and the vague variety as
she heard it noticed, on pure trust,
pleased at what pleased the others—it
was not like England, indeed, but
how pure and exhilarating seemed the
French air—its sun gave a still sleepier
stillness to her mild eyes, yet with so
healthy a tint and soft fulness of person,
that the holding of her parasol,
in Lady Willoughby, the trouble she
took to observe an object, were pleasant
to see; as Mr Thorpe, riding by,
devoted his conversation to the governess
and her; the while Charles, still
in a discontented mood, vented it on
the whole country, and leaning across
to his sister, one elbow on his knee,
kept up his side-current of livelier
talk.</p>

<p class='c009'>For one thing, their constant popularity
displeased him, however acceptable
to Rose. That national sharpness
and curiosity had all at once
become particularly disagreeable to
the youth, in his grumbling humour;
and it mingled through the whole
thread of his discourse, not without
some acute notions of the people’s character,
on which he appeared to have
been oddly brooding. Nor the less was
his zest in showing that France and
England were natural foes, because his
tutor on the other side rode discoursing
benevolently to the reverse effect;
while Mrs Mason responded, in all
that propriety of sentiment, which was
blended, in her dialogue to gentlemen,
with a slight shade of delicate reserve.
But really there was a domineering
style of argument in Charles, if one
ventured to express a different view,
that provoked his sister in the end—especially
as he was a year younger;
she turned her shoulder to him, and
sat resolutely looking the other way,
as if absorbed in the mild commonplaces
of Mr Thorpe, and Mrs Mason’s
weary platitudes, which diffused
such additional complacency over
her mother. After all, they <em>were</em>
tiresome things, such as all good
books and worthy people said over
and over; though Charles had no
right to look down on his tutor with
such secret contempt, because he knew
nothing of what Charles called “life”—or
to hint, because he looked serious,
that his mind had got bewildered
among triangles ever since
he studied so terribly for a degree,
leaving out nothing but his memory:
perhaps, indeed, it <em>might</em> be true that
Mrs Mason, in spite of her early loss
of some inestimable kind, had a sort
of soft regard for him, and paid him
little attentions, especially at table,
with the sugar,—though moderately,
till the curacy at Stoke should be
sure; but what she would not for a
moment be so disrespectful to Mr
Thorpe as to credit, was that a hopeless
love, never to be revealed, consumed
him, amidst all his learning,
for—for herself. Her indignation
mounted at the thought,—for a moment
even at the excellent tutor, so
highly respected by Sir Godfrey, with
his thin hair already leaving his forehead
bald, through long delay of any
preferment—whose sister was his only
relative alive, and was to keep his
house when he had one,—but most to
Charles, with his rough boy’s jokes;
even although the girl’s thoughts
wandered the more irresistibly to
foreign counts and picturesque barons
that had hovered in vision before the
whole boarding-school, being now
eagerly inquired after by her dearest
friend, who was still there.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were none of these, certainly,
about the highway which the carriage
struck into, alive though it was with
people of every kind. Charles had
ceased, at his mother’s unusually
earnest request, to whistle indistinctly
between his teeth, as it was of all
sounds the one that most annoyed
her; he had even left off, of his own
accord, the substitution of a drumming
motion with a small cane against
his boot, as he superciliously noticed
the passengers. He got quite silent,
in fact, to watch the passing faces
that seemed bent towards Paris;
though the faint smoke of another
large village appeared in the hollow,
prettier than any they had passed,
among inclining vineyards and whole
knolls of roses. It might have been
St Genevieve’s own, with that holy
well resorted to by kings, where
she had kept her sheep long ago; and
where, at the May fête of <i><span lang="fr">la rosière</span></i>,
they still crowned the most virtuous
girl in the place with roses; as the
last work of Madame de Genlis had
informed Mrs Mason. The summer
afternoon sloped wide above it, full
of light and the swarming hum of
insects, through the outspread walnut
leaves, flickering amber in the
sun, from over the white wall that
was dappled by the shadows; while
the hedgeless corn-fields on the other
side were rippling under the long air
from the woods, one sea of tenderest
green, full of blue-cockle flowers and
scarlet poppies; the cottage casements
flashed from amidst a pink-white
glow of orchard-blossom, of
milky cherry-boughs, of old rugged
propped-up pear-trees that foamed
over to the moss-green thatch, with
the wooden chimney shot high, as it
breathed blue among the leaves; with
here and there a hooded dovecot window
on the roof, where the pigeons
sat sunning and swelling themselves,
and cooing, white, blue, and purple
together, in a gush of warm light—all
the place beneath them bespattered
and splashed with whiteness,
through the shadow, to the very
foliage of the nearest branch. The
hum of the place burst round them as
they crossed its little bridge, rattling
over the rough causeway; and there
were no carriage-ways save through
the villages and towns.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was odd that for some time along
the road, as if to meet the lad’s inclinations,
the notice of them had been
unaccompanied with signs of interest;
every one had seemed occupied with
his neighbour, talking, or hastening
on somewhere; the voices had even
grown suppressed as they passed.
Here they were busier still, and talking
louder, in a perfect babble of
sounds. It was wonderful, at least
to Charles Willoughby in his private
mind, how the cobblers lived—the
weavers, blacksmiths, or carpenters,
found time to work; how the mill-wheel
had a hand to feed it, or the
women to mind their matters; they
were letting their pitchers run over,
in fact, at the old carved fountain-spout,
till there was a little brook
across the street, down into some
one’s door-steps, and a duck that
seemed comparatively quiet began to
lead her troop of ducklings that way.
The French infants even, held plainly
enough here and there, in full sunlight,
to their slatternly feeding-places,
looked dissatisfied as the throng
pressed about the doorway of a cabaret,
with the sign of the Golden
Crown: a horse stood by it with
foam-flecked sides, and his head
stooped in its corn-bag; while a man
in a green jacket, with a leather case
slung across him by a belt, apparently
a courier, gesticulated in vain from
the open window; the door being
blocked up by a drunk dragoon, who
stood swaying slightly to and fro, yet
balancing himself carefully, as he surveyed
the various groups from his
half-closed eyelids with extreme sternness
and grave suspicion; till at length
drawing himself up, to extend his
hand with a summons for attention,
he essayed to speak; but all at once
rushed forward with furious gesture
amongst the crowd, where he fell flat
from the steps. The blood gushed
from his features, women shrieking,
men running, without a glance behind,
as the landlord hurried to his
aid from the tavern, followed by more
dragoons, who stamped their spurred
feet upon the steps, and half drew
their sabres, with fierce gestures and
execrations. Yet as the carriage
passed on through the narrow and
awkward street, however slowly, it
did not attract attention from any of
the party except Charles, who preserved
a seemingly sullen silence; not
distracted by so much as a look to his
sister, when her governess said there
must be something improper going on,
and sloped her parasol that way,
using a scented handkerchief, with
evident desire that the young lady
should do the same; while his mother
had no more suspicion of its not being
common to villages all over the world,
possibly on a market-day, than a
duchess. The tutor was, as usual, on
before, with his little note-book, to
put down the name of the place, the
probable population, and apparent
area of the church, according to some
dim theory that had been growing on
him since he crossed the Channel. As
for Jackson, he merely whipped his
horses, and made a slash at some
dogs, with obvious inclination to curse
whatever came in his way. So they
rolled through by degrees in sight of
the church; but there was a greater
throng at that end, in and about the
low-walled enclosure before a smart
new building, the use of which was
not plain at first sight; for considering
the size of the place, with the
general squalidness of the long cottages
or bald white houses, really the
number of people of all ages was extraordinary,
till one observed that single
roofs seemed shared among ever so
many families,—a thing the odder to
the lad, as at school he used to know
plenty of Eton folks, from bargemen
to bat-maker. He even thought,
somehow, of that one visit to Stoke.
Oh! that was the school—the first he
happened to have seen in France;
and that youngish man, in an old
figured dressing-gown, with a sharp
dry face, standing up on something,
without a hat—the schoolmaster;
while they pushed and jumped to hear
him, though quietly enough except
for the hushing of each other, since
the schoolmaster had evidently a weak
voice; it only reached the carriage in
an occasional screech, when he lifted
his hand impressively in the air.
“<i><span lang="fr">Ecoutez—ecoutez, au Père Pierre!</span></i>”
This Père Pierre must be rather an
odd fellow; why, his school was in a
perfect riot within, to judge by the
dust, the flying books, and the noise
sometimes louder than his voice outside.
But he was not making a
speech—the white article he held up
to the blaze of the sun was not a
pocket-handkerchief, but—yes—a
newspaper. He must have a good
deal of influence there, this teacher—at
least over the grown-up men, with
leather aprons and bare arms—one
could not help marking him—with
that scanty head of hair done up in
bobs from his temples, and such a
short queue behind, not to think
of his short nose and high cheekbones,
or a chin as bare as one’s
palm. Perhaps something had happened—something
important—a
battle somewhere? There was peace,
though. Some murder, it was likely—or
a shipwreck—well, at any rate
these boys didn’t mind, so crop-headed
and stunted-looking, who were playing
pitch-and-toss with such an old-mannish
look in their eager faces, at
the end of the school. There were
more beneath the big bulging church-gable,
with its black ugly windows
and its zigzag crack in the plaster—in
such long old livery coats, with
plated saucer-buttons. Actually it
was with the buttons they were playing—as
if it had been money—cutting
them off their coats, too, and their
breeches, to rush back for another
chance! The silent speculations of
Charles reached their climax in profound
wonder. It was beneath his
notice to regard Mrs Mason’s words,
as they cleared the place, and began
to rise from the hollow—that it was
an interesting village, so lively, so
full of a holiday air, not without a
degree of quick intelligence. “After
labour,” his mother said, lifting up
her eyelids, “it must be pleasant.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Beyond the church and an old
crooked, high-arched bridge, was Mr
Thorpe in the turning of a very narrow
by-road, stony and grass-grown, that
took a winding as if to avoid the village,
by ditch-side and over rubbish,
till it caught the highway behind
again: the worthy tutor had drawn
up his horse, he was settling his spectacles,
putting in his note-book, and
feeling in his pocket for some coin,
apparently to bestow on a man he had
been talking to. A very singular
group revealed itself as they reached
him. A dark-faced jet-eyed man
with a beard, black and bushy, his
rough cap in hand, and a little organ
slung from his back, stood replying to
Mr Thorpe in strange broken French,
mingled with English; while he seemed
carefully to keep the trees between
himself and the village: somewhat
further down the by-way sat a disconsolate-looking
boy with a guitar, beside
a crouching monkey; while another
man held the chain of a huge
muzzled beast, shaggy and brown,
which reared on its hind-legs, now
growling, now dancing, now shrinking
from the threatened whip, like a creature
enraged by the distant voices.
Their trade had been ruined, the man
said; for it was the first time they
had been turned out into the <i><span lang="fr">chemin
des affronteux</span></i>, belonging to thieves
and villains. It would be known for
miles round Paris in a day, for it was
wonderful how the news travelled
there. They had often been at Charlemont
before, and were received well.
The bear felt it worst, he thought.
He was as good a bear as you would
see, owing to his love of society. Perhaps
it might have been owing to
some news in the place—but one
could not know what tunes would
offend people nowadays, to dance to.</p>

<p class='c009'>At Mr Thorpe’s condolence, however,
backed by his gift of a six-sous
piece, the Italian retreated thankfully.
They watched him as he was joined
by his singular company, slowly and
with a crestfallen air disappearing
round the by-way. All the tutor
could find out was that they had been
chased out from that end of the place
just before, with sticks, stones, and
pitchforks, by the very young people
who had been dancing sociably enough
along with the bear and monkey—because
an air they commenced was
<i><span lang="fr">contre la liberté</span></i>. How any tune
could be against liberty, Mr Thorpe
could not conceive: nay, if they did
not like dancing to it, they might
have stood still; they might have requested
it to be stopped; indeed, it
was probable that some of these very
people might have wished the liberty
of dancing it! Still less could he perceive
how <em>liberty</em> could be connected
with that particular tune—“<cite><span lang="fr">Richard
o mon roi</span></cite>”? And he looked interrogatively
to Mrs Mason. Certainly
not, the governess responded: Gretry’s
new music! In fact, he rejoined,
the musician could not, either:
but that day mysteries seemed to
grow, he added,—for, before himself
emerging from the place, at sight of
the church, he had very civilly inquired,
from a group of inhabitants,
what was the name of the village.
What had been his astonishment to
perceive, that passing from uncivil
silence, from stares of wonder, and
extraordinary, sudden indignation,
they looked very much disposed to
treat him as it now seemed they had
before treated these inoffensive strangers.
Until, adding insult, they had
significantly touched their foreheads,
looking to each other, or whispering,
until one, perhaps still more ingenious
in giving offence, had suddenly
called out, “Bah! c’est un Anglais!”
There had been then no farther notice
of him—indeed absolute indifference;
nor did he discover, till he encountered
the injured foreigner, what the
name of the place actually was. And
was there, then, really any peculiar
crime in asking the name of <em>Charlemont</em>—any
strange privacy—any unutterable
horror connected with <em>it</em>—that
no one should put the mere question?
But, at all events, was a spirit
of inquiry to be thought madness!
Nay more, was it lower than madness
to be—an Englishman!</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr Thorpe looked a little discomposed
and changed, in fact, even
since they last had seen him. Usually,
though not pedantic, he was
tedious; but he began for a moment
to appear almost respectable in the
very eyes of his pupil, who had often
thought before that the present curate
at Stoke could not be more monotonous,
nor the old rector duller: a spark
of spirit seemed for the time to have
given emphasis to his words, and
meaning to his face—some faint dignity
to his lengthy awkward person, sitting
ordinarily like a sack on his horse,
with the gaiters dangling in the stirrups.
Yet how amazingly simple
was Mr Thorpe; it was chiefly the
Italian with his battered instruments
and beaten animals that seemed to
have roused him from his wont: while
as for his chief puzzle, a light broke on
it to the boy at once, from all he had
seen and heard of these French. Why,—of
course they thought the whole
world should know Charlemont already!</p>

<p class='c009'>But, to the ladies, softly plashed
and clattered below, from among
alders in the deeper hollow, the mill-wheel
of the village, dusty light
flying from the upper door: the
cracked striking of a clock was heard
from farther off, till they saw the
grey turrets of another yellow chateau
among trees, though but a thread of
smoke rose from it, and its discoloured
plaster, where the sunlight struck,
gave it a dilapidated aspect, helped
by the pigeons from the dovecote
tower close by, that were sitting on
the window-sills and eaves. Full to
the light on the brow of the eminence
rose the carriage, widening the landscape
on every side, save where the
woods before it extended: there was
a smooth, broad road in front, sweeping
round where the labourers were
still at work on it: they were on a
hill, and all was exquisitely solitary
otherwise for the first time, except
close by, where the highway ran
between the two porter’s-lodges of
two great gates that faced each other.
These great gates were, indeed, gorgeously
beautiful, being each double,
with side-wickets, all of open ironwork,
elaborately complex; gilt
crowns surmounted the globes upon
their massy pillars of stone, their
upper rims were formed of fleur-delis,
as if of lance-heads, richly gilded;
while the blade-shaped leaves, damasked
and lettered with mottoes,
stretched throughout the whole,
hither and thither, like guardian
swords, from the uncouth grasp of
grotesque naked monsters at the
lower corners; everywhere were small
puzzling circles of cipher, and in the
midst the joined halves composed a
grand shield-shaped device, burnished
and resplendent on either hand,
of the royal arms of France. The
very radiance of the afternoon sun
came dazzling towards it, and threw
the other way on the cross road, into
one park, a mottled shadow of fleur-de-lis;
shapes of crowns, ciphers,
and monsters, even vanished among
the dust of the horses’ feet on the
highway as they trotted past—strange
traces from the days of Louis
Quatorze. Still was all that nothing
to the broad glimpses of park scenery
both ways through them. Mrs Mason
herself saw one way, with unusual
commendation, where a stately distance
was made by Lenotre’s taste,
in straight avenue, level turf, and
high-clipped side-alleys, where a few
well-dressed people were walking;
her frequent headache did not, perhaps,
at any time wholly leave her,
but the vinaigrette paused in her
hand, as she directed the attention
of Lady and Miss Willoughby to each
fine effect. Yet it was difficult to
draw the latter from her absorbed
delight the other way; for there the
wilder chase seemed left to nature, the
sun levelled more and more all his
yellowing splendour through its deep-green,
sinking glades, flinging out
fantastic shadows, shooting gushes of
verdurous light, in which the delicate
young fern peeped from about the
trunk of some far-off oak, while the
broad umbrage of its gnarled boughs
retreated crisply into cooler shade;
the knolls were hung with the foxglove
buds, like crimson bells that
had not found a tongue; and all there
was moist, secluded, solitary, sweet,
save when some single bird seemed to
wake up and make it musical, till
again it trilled and rang with their
innumerable notes. But gradually
the road had lifted the carriage higher
yet; it seemed to drive slow by instinct;
and ere they well knew, the
whole party made exclamations together,
as, with Rose, they did not
know which way to look first. Mr
Thorpe came to a stand-still, and
Jackson was shading his eyes, whip
in hand, to look under the sun. Even
Lady Willougbby said, fanning herself
gently, “Dear me—what a fine
country! what crops!” “Yes—the
harvest will be excellent, I should
think,” Mrs Mason replied, using her
fan also, it was so hot. The young
lady stood up, and her brother jumped
out to get from the top of the bank
upon the wall.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were nearer Paris than they
thought; it bristled and shone
through its haze, some miles away on
the plain: westward, the high woods
of Marly showed faint through the
edges of two broad sunbeams, as
through a veil, with bluer distinctness
between, here a spire, there smoke;
the waves of forest verdure undulating
round, began to burn and blaze
towards sunset; all was spotted with
towns, sprinkled rich-red and white
with villages, flushed with orchards,
and in the barer spaces embroidered
like a carpet that blended with the
dark suburbs of the city on the horizon.
Here and there appeared a soft misty
glitter of the circuitous Seine in the
level, with some faint white sails;
the distant azure of some hills could
be seen; it was all like one mighty
map made real. Yet greatest of all
to their eyes, even greater than the
dusky grimness of Paris in the sun,
showing its domes so helmet-like, and
its pinnacles so like weapons—was
where, with one accord looking back,
they could perceive the silvered slates
of one large town among the avenues
they had turned from that forenoon,
its steeples shining, its windows
sparkling—and through that transparent
French air, some lustrous
snowy glimpses between embosoming
bowers, of long level palace-roofs,
embossed, and fringed, and tipped
with undistinguishable ornament.
Palaces, indeed, seemed to be visible
in every direction; but they thickened
towards <em>it</em>; all that way the landscape
was but one mass of park-woods, and
with those alleys, gardens, terraces,
that long road at intervals perceived,
it could be nothing but Versailles!
Charles himself could not but look.
The rainbow flashing of the fountains,
and gleam of statues—the grand stairs
of the terrace—they could almost
fancy they distinguished.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was he who first broke the thread
of their interest. Well, he shouldn’t
care to have seen King Louis XVI.;
he had once seen George III. It was
easy enough to see him, in fact; if you
only but knew it was he. He had seen
a boy at Eton, fag to a friend of his,
who was once spoken to a good while
at a turnstile in Windsor Park by an
elderly gentleman in drab gaiters, a
nankeen waistcoat, and a blue coat
with bright buttons; and when a
ranger came up afterwards from
behind, and told him it was the king,
he nearly fainted. He could never
learn anything after that, and always
turned pale at the sight of a gold
sovereign, so he had to be sent to
sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear young gentleman,” said
Mr Thorpe seriously, “the King of
France is a much more powerful
monarch than even His Majesty King
George! I must beg to correct you
on a point of history. He is absolute
ruler, not only of all the land we see,
but over the property, nay, the very
persons of his subjects—he is the State
himself—as the great Louis XIV.
so emphatically told his nobles. Think
of those <i><span lang="fr">lettres du cachet</span></i>, given away
even blank in thousands upon thousands—a
kind of money, as it were—exchanged
by the courtiers for all
kinds of objects—with which, for all
one knows, were he worth notice from
some enemy, he may be sent to a
Bastille on no account whatever, to
remain there unknown the rest of his
life!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Charles Willoughby still endeavoured
to look indifferent, though the
slight whistle died between his teeth,
while he pushed his cap down on his
head, deeply resolved never to lift it
to a French king. Mr Thorpe, drawn
into unwonted earnestness, by the
expression of the ladies’ faces, sought
to reassure them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The character of the present king
is such as to make this power a benefit,”
he said. “There seems a rapid
decrease of superstition in the church.
Really, Lady Willoughby, there was
something idolatrous in this excessive
honour to a human being! To conceive
that at his Majesty’s death, while
the body lay for forty days embalmed
in lead, a waxen effigy was placed in
the grand hall of entertainment, and
served by gentlemen-waiters at the
usual times, while the meal was
blessed by the almoner, the meat
carved, and the wine presented to the
figure; its hands were washed and
thanks returned. The queen, in
white mourning—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In white mourning?” inquired the
governess, with interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In white, I think, Mrs Mason—sat
for six weeks in a chamber lighted
by lamps alone. For a whole year
she could not stir out of her own apartments,
if she had received the intelligence
there. Although similar ceremonies
were observed after her own
decease.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The feminine impression of former
evils in France grew deep. The tutor
could not say whether his present
majesty would require such honours.
There was only one person of inferior
rank who had ever been distinguished
by a shade of the same respect, though
for a shorter time her effigy had sat.
It was the far Gabrielle d’Estrées.
“Who was she?” Rose asked,—“and
why”—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Miss Willoughby,” interrupted
Mrs Mason with a sudden air of severity,
rustling and extending and drawing
herself erect, “there are some
questions too shocking and improper
for us to ask?” Mr Thorpe, with a
frightened look, sat dumb in his saddle;
yet Mrs Mason professed to know
history, and her charge must surely
learn it: nay, unknown to them all,
among the distant chateaus, palaces,
and mansions they were gazing at,
were St Germain’s in the blue eminence,
which the great Louis had given
to La Vallière when he wearied of her
for Madame de Montespan; and Luciennes,
where Madame du Barry
was then living in fashionable retirement.
But the one had been gallant,
stately even in his vices; the royal
patron of the other, in his dissipations,
had at least been elegant. Probably
Mr Thorpe’s confusion led him to a
graver topic.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The chronicler I have lately perused,”
he said, hastily, “is really
worth study. Nothing can be so
mournfully salutary. As the coffin
was borne at night to yonder Notre
Dame, and thence thereafter to the
ancient town of St Denis, the streets
were hung with black, and before
every house was planted a tall lighted
torch of white wax. First went the
Capuchins, in their coarse sackcloth
girt with ropes, bearing their huge
cross, crowned with thorns—then five
hundred poor men, under their bailiff,
all in mourning as for a father—the
magistrates and courts of justice, the
parliament of Paris in rich sable furs,
the high clergy in purple and gold—followed
by the funeral car drawn by
white horses, covered with black velvet
crossed with white satin, and the
long train of officers of the household.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The great knowledge of the tutor
as to textile fabrics interested Mrs
Mason. “Think of the expense!”
Lady Willoughby said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This vast procession,” pursued
Mr Thorpe with solemnity, “went on
in silence, while, as the chronicler
quaintly expresses it, ‘ever and aye
the royal musicians made a sound of
lamentation, with instruments clothed
in crape, very fierce and marvellously
dolorous to hear or to behold, until
they arrived at the church of St Denis,—blessed
be his name! And the bier
was borne into the choir, it being
a-blaze with lamps and tapers beyond
number, and the service lasted for the
King’s soul several days—whereupon
was the body let down into the vault,
but not admitted within the inner
chamber until the end of the next
reign—and Normandy, the most ancient
king of arms, summoned with a
loud voice, that the high dignitaries
should therein deposit their ensigns
and truncheons of command—which
done, the sacred oriflamme of France
was let fall down upon the coffin,
until the <em>fleur-de-lis</em> began with the
noble Bourbons—and the king of arms
cried three times so that the
vaults heard and replied—Ho! the
king is dead! The king is dead! The
king is dead! And when silence had
been renewed, the same voice proclaimed—Long
live the king!—and all
the other heralds repeated it. Then
was all finished, and they departed
joyously.’ Really, in those older
writers, compared with those of the
present day,—however superstitious,
there is considerable profit to be
found.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And the worthy graduate settled
his glasses complacently, used his
pocket-handkerchief in the loud manner
he was addicted to, and looked
round with increased attention on the
mighty view; for devouter wishes had
long been breeding dimly in his mind,
such as the chill Protestantism even
of his revered mother-church did not
at that period satisfy. He did not
notice the shrinking, under that full
sunlight and wide azure, with the
swarm of summer flies in the ears,
and the warble of birds at hand, with
which the youngest of his hearers, at
least, felt the thought of death—above
all, that universal one, of sovereign
power. As for Lady Willoughby,
her anxious look was chiefly from a
reference to her watch; and it had
been growing. She had not even
heard Mr Thorpe. It was time for
them to turn into the road from Versailles,
as Colonel Willoughby—Sir
Godfrey—would soon be leaving Paris,
and he was punctual to a moment.
There was no other way, Jackson said
in reply, but by turning right again
through the last village; at his mistress’s
request, accordingly, he suited
the action to the word, by backing
and wheeling round. But where was
Charles? He had vanished over the
wall, apparently, during his tutor’s
irrelevant remarks. To the calls of Mr
Thorpe, echoed from among the woods,
he returned no sign. It was annoying.
They must wait; and, at any
rate, according to the views of Jackson,
generally unfavourable if required—with
these beasts, it would be impossible
to get on in good time, besides
having to walk through that village,
which was like nothing English
whatever—with perhaps a bucket
of water needed at that there tavern,
if such a thing was to be had. The
sudden intelligence of Mr Thorpe suggested
a way: he could ride off at
once to meet Sir Godfrey, and set him
at ease; in fact, for himself, at least,
it would be easy to avoid the village
of Charlemont altogether—by—yes—by
taking that <i><span lang="fr">chemin des affronteux</span></i>,
as they called it. Lady Willoughby’s
face brightened. Her thanks to Mr
Thorpe were something energetic for
<em>her</em>: and spurring, rising in his stirrups,
bumping up and down on his white
mare, that worthy man disappeared.
Rose pressed her parasol against her
mouth to repress a smile, at the
thought how Charles would have
enjoyed his following the bear and
monkey: but, through <em>her</em> means,
she was resolved he should know
nothing of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>When least expected, Charles reappeared,
jumping with a flushed face
over the wall, and carrying a load of
wild-flowers for his mother, for Rose,
even for Miss Mason. He had heard
distant sounds over the woods of the
chase, which he thought were those of
hunting-horns. But all was again
still, bright, sleepy and solitary, under
the glory of the sloping sun. He got
in; Jackson whipped his horses at last
to a trot, for again and again they had
been passed each way by humbler
vehicles; and they rolled on their
way back towards Charlemont. Mr
Thorpe’s mission excited no extraordinary
satisfaction in Charles, though
he was sure they would get on better
without him. Mr Thorpe ran a strong
chance of being taken up as a spy. All
at once it occurred to him that Mr
Thorpe had all their passports. But
a scene of far more exciting interest
next moment eclipsed everything like
that. Again, from the distance of those
secluded glades, did a sound draw his
ear—and it was really the sound of a
bugle-horn—a faint, far-off, musical
sound, sometimes smothered by the
woods, then breaking out clearer. It
sank into a long-drawn, almost wailing
note, that rose up into a livelier
quaver, joined by a burst from others.
It must be a hunt. They were blowing
the <em>Mort</em>—as they did only for a
stag, and a stag that was dead. Such
luck!—for it came ever nearer. But
what a crowd at the turning, near
those splendid gates—twenty times
even Charlemont must be there, by the
swarming noise! And the gates themselves,
thrown each way open with
their double leaves, closed up the
road.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lad rose half up, with breath
suspended, and without a look to
spare for his party, kept mute as the
carriage rolled into the crowd on that
side. He did not so much as think
what it could be.</p>

<p class='c009'>Though had there been a chance of
the <i><span lang="fr">chemin des affronteux</span></i>, and the carriage
could have gone through it—indeed
through one long enough and
circuitous enough to avoid all France—it
might have been better for the
Willoughbies. Yet who knows? The
master-history that shapes our ends
is wiser than we.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>
  <h2 class='c002'>CONSERVATIVE REASCENDANCY CONSIDERED.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Ours is an age of peculiar importance.
Events seem to be crowded
into a small space of time which, if,
spread over half a century, would yet
mark the time as one of peril, action,
and renown. In the political world
we view a rapid succession of exciting
scenes. The calm of peace yields
to the turmoil of war, and Europe,
but lately placid, is now rocked to
its very base, and every nation on
the Continent seems torn with present
evils or convulsed in the contemplation
of those to come. The strife of
nations has doubtless called forth all
the energies of mankind; and though
England is removed from the sphere
of action, and the immediate influence
of the war, yet it cannot be said but
that she, too, lies in peril, and partakes
the general restlessness of the
times. It becomes her, then, to consider
in what lies her safety, and into
whose hands she should commit the
guidance of her affairs at this moment
of danger.</p>

<p class='c009'>Is not England, too, a sharer in
this general convulsion? Let us look
to her senate, the heart of this great
nation, where all the movements by
which she is agitated can be seen and
analysed. First, we see the Whigs
quarrelling amongst themselves, and
their consequent fall from power.
Next, we see the Conservative party,
with the general acquiescence of the
country, installed in power. Ten
short months have elapsed, and we
see that Government, after having
conferred, in its short tenure of office,
lasting benefits upon the country,
now falling, though by a slight majority,
before a combination of all those
various sects, panting for office, which
range between conservatism and turbulent
democracy—between Popery
on the one hand, and practical atheism
on the other; at war amongst themselves,
yet combined together against
a Government which seemed determined
to legislate for the country, and not
for the exclusive interests of any one
party. Well might the Minister exclaim,
as he fell before the machinations
of his enemies, prescient of the
future, while contemplating the events
of the present—“England has not
loved coalitions.” Well might he
“appeal from that coalition to that
public opinion which governs this
country,” and before whose searching
tribunal that unprincipled combination
must soon be brought. If he
desired revenge, he has it now. A
government of “all the talents,” containing,
as we are told, within its
ranks all the men of official experience,
administrative ability, of parliamentary
renown, and so forth,
calling down upon them the contempt
of Parliament and the scorn of the
country, succeeds the Derby administration.
Forced to abandon measure
after measure, fairly vanquished
in those with which they proceed,
obliged to fall back upon their own
imagined talent and ability, which
must at any sacrifice of character be
preserved at the service of the country,
they are evidently, to all men but
themselves, and a few of their own
devoted adherents, eliciting the pity
of their friends and the derision of
their enemies. But, then, we are told
that it is the war which prevents them
from carrying their measures; that
last session they carried their budget,
India bill, &#38;c., with large majorities,
which they regard as a sign that they
possess the confidence of Parliament,
and that now Parliament and the
country, with their attention distracted
by the war, simply refuse to legislate.
We protest against such arguments
as these. It is introducing a dangerous
principle, though it may serve as
an excuse for clinging to office with a
disgraceful pertinacity. But does it
not occur to them, that probably the
reason they carried their measures
last year with such a semblance of
triumph, was in consequence of that
forbearance—nay, even favour—with
which every government, new to
office, is regarded; that it was, to a
great extent, the result of that disorganisation
of their opponents which
ever follows defeat; and that the
people, dazzled with appearances,
were willing to admit that we had a
government which was worthy of the
confidence of the country. But how
have these feelings been dispelled?
Credulity or connivance, disgraceful
in such keen-sighted and patriotic
statesmen, has done it all—Parliament
has lost confidence in them, and the
country contemns them. Moreover,
blinded by their confidence in their
own talents, which has now become
a byword among sensible men, they
still declare they carry with them the
confidence of the country, because in
all matters connected with the war
they still possess majorities. Such
reasoning as this does not hold. The
reason that they carry their financial
measures so decisively through the
House is, that many, who do not feel
so strongly as others on the injustice
of the measures proposed, are willing
to support those measures rather
than have it appear on the Continent
that the House of Commons has refused
the sinews of war at the very
commencement of the struggle. It is
not the war which prevents their
carrying other measures, it is the war
which enables them to carry what
they do.</p>

<p class='c009'>But how has this been brought
about?—how is it that this Government
has so rapidly lost the favour of
the people, and been reduced to the
position of being a Government on sufferance?
The reason is to be found in
that general discontent and excitement
which from Europe have infected
England. Men are excited at what
is passing abroad, and distrustful of
affairs within. The want of union and
mutual distrust which exist in headquarters,
is spread throughout the
kingdom. Those feelings of distrust
and disagreement existing in the
Government become every day more
apparent, and add to the anxiety with
which its motions are regarded. This
distrust and anxiety must be prevalent
whilst this state of things continues.
It is only by the reascendancy of the
Conservative party that they can
be surmounted, and by the advent
to power of men who have confidence
in each other, who have unity
of sentiment amongst themselves,
and who are backed by united
followers; who have, each and all,
the same objects in view—viz., a
firm resistance to Russian aggression
and the establishment of a durable
peace, the maintenance of our Protestant
religion, and justice to all
parties in the State. Unity of sentiment
amongst the members of a government
is of the greatest importance
to the happiness and welfare of the
people. There never, probably, was
a Cabinet in which there were so
many “open questions” as the present.
Since so many of them are
Peelites, we may as well have the
opinion of Sir Robert Peel himself on
those self-same open questions. We
subjoin an extract of a speech delivered
in 1840 by that eminent statesman,
on a motion of want of confidence
in Ministers, in which he refers,
without any ambiguity of expression,
to the fatality of open questions:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“But there is a new resource for an
incompetent Administration—there is the
ingenious device of open questions, the
cunning scheme of adding to the strength
of a weak government by proclaiming
its disunion. It will be a fatal policy,
indeed, if that which has hitherto been
an exception, and always an unfortunate
exception in recent times, is hereafter to
constitute the rule of Government. If
every government may say, ‘We feel
pressed by those behind us—we find ourselves
unable, by steadily maintaining
our own opinions, to command the majority
and retain the confidence of our
followers, our remedy is an easy one—let
us make each question an open question,
and thereby destroy every obstacle
to every possible combination;’—what
will be the consequence? The exclusion
of honourable and able men from the
conduct of affairs, and the unprincipled
coalition of the refuse of every party.
The right honourable gentleman has said
that there have been instances of ‘open
questions’ in the recent history of this
country. There have been; but there
has scarcely been one that has not been
pregnant with evil, and which has not
been branded by an impartial posterity
with censure and disgrace. He said,
that in 1782 Mr Fox made Parliamentary
Reform an open question; that Mr
Pitt did so on the Slave-trade; and that the
Catholic Question was an open one. Why,
if ever lessons were written for your instruction,
to guard you against the recurrence
to open questions, you will find
them in these melancholy examples. The
first instance was the coalition of Mr Fox
and Lord North, which could not have
taken place without open questions.
Does the right honourable gentleman
know that that very fact—the union in
office of men who had differed, and continued
to differ on great constitutional
and vital questions—produced such a
degree of discontent and disgust, as to
lead to the disgraceful expulsion of that
Government? The second instance was
that of the Slave-trade; but has not
that act of Mr Pitt (the permitting of
the Slave-trade to be an open question)
been more condemned than any other
act of his public life? The next instance
cited was that of the Catholic Question.
I have had some experience of the evils
which arose from making Catholic emancipation
an open question. All parties in
this House were equally responsible for
them. Fox made it an open question;
Pitt made it an open question; Lord
Liverpool made it an open question;
Canning made it an open question. Each
had to plead an urgent necessity for
tolerating disunion in the Cabinet on this
great question; but there cannot be a
doubt that the practical result of that disunion
was to introduce discord amongst
public men, and to paralyse the vigour of
the executive government. Every act of
administration was tainted by disunion
in the Cabinet. Every party was jealous
of the predominance of the other. Each
party must be represented in the government
of that very country which required,
above all things, a united and resolute
Government. There must be a lord-lieutenant
of one class of opinions, a secretary
of the opposite, beginning their administration
in harmony, but in spite of themselves
becoming each the nucleus of a
party, gradually converting reciprocal
confidence into jealousy and distrust. It
was my conviction of the evils of such a
state of things—of the long experience
of distracted councils, of the curse of an
open question, as it affected the practical
government of Ireland—it was this conviction,
and not the fear of physical force,
that convinced me that the policy must
be abandoned. I do not believe that the
making the Catholic question an open
question facilitated the ultimate settlement
of it. If the decided friends of
emancipation had refused to unite in government
with its opponents, the question
would have been settled at an earlier
period, and (as it ought to have been)
under better auspices. So much for the
encouraging examples of the right honourable
gentleman. They were fatal exceptions
from the general policy of Government.
If, as I before observed, such exceptions
are to constitute the future rule
of Government, there is an end to public
confidence in the honour and integrity
of great political parties, a severance of
all ties which constitute party connections,
a premium upon the shabby and
shuffling conduct of unprincipled politicians.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Such were the sentiments of Sir
Robert Peel with regard to open questions
in the Melbourne Cabinet: how
much more completely those remarks
apply to the present Government it
is needless to point out. Again are
the open questions in the Melbourne
Cabinet vigorously attacked; but
this time in the House of Lords,
and by a more energetic and fiery
orator:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“My Lords,—‘<i><span lang="la">Idem sentire de republicâ</span></i>’
has been in all times, and amongst the
best of statesmen, a bond of union at once
intelligible, honourable, conducive to the
common weal. But there is another kind
of union formed of baser materials—a tie
that knits together far different natures,
the ‘<i><span lang="la">eadem velle atque nolle</span></i>,’ and of this
it has been known and been said, ‘<i><span lang="la">ea demum,
inter malos, est prime amicitia</span></i>.’
The abandonment of all opinions, the sacrifice
of every sentiment, the preference
of sordid interest to honest principle, the
utter abdication of the power to act as
conscience dictates and sense of duty recommends—such
is the vile dross of which
the links are made which bind profligate
men together in a ‘covenant of shame;’
a confederacy to seek their own advancement
at the expense of every duty;—and
this, my Lords, is the literal meaning of
‘open questions.’ It is that each has his
known recorded opinions, but that each is
willing to sacrifice them rather than break
up the government to which he belongs:
the ‘<i><span lang="la">velle</span></i>’ is to keep in office, the ‘<i><span lang="la">nolle</span></i>’
to keep out all antagonists; and none
dare speak his mind in his official capacity
without losing the ‘<i><span lang="la">firmitas amicitiæ</span></i>,’ by
shaking the foundations of the Government.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Here is a splendid outburst of vehement
denunciation. If that could be
applied with justice to the Government
of Lord Melbourne, if such an invective
as that is an index of the state of
opinion in the country at that time,
with reference to the dissensions in
the Whig Cabinet, how much more
applicable is it to the Coalition of the
present day, with regard to whose
members, putting out of sight the
question of Free Trade, which is now
the law of the land, there is hardly
a question of public importance to
which we can point as an example
that ‘<i><span lang="la">idem sentire de republicâ</span></i>’ is
their bond of union.  Discontent
and anxiety may well prevail when
we have, in times so important as
these, a Ministry in power so disunited,
and composed of such discordant elements,
such base materials as the present,
and backed by followers who,
true to their nature, are constantly
quarrelling amongst themselves. Look
at the diversity of sentiment displayed
in their recorded speeches on that subject
which, more than any other, is
uppermost in the minds of the people.
There is Lord John Russell in the
House of Commons inveighing against
the criminal ambition of the Czar of
Russia, declaring that “this enormous
power has got to such a pitch, that
even in its moderation it resembles the
ambition of other states;” arguing
that that power must be checked; telling
the people of England that they
must be prepared to enter the contest
with a stout heart and a willing mind,
and then solemnly invoking the God of
justice to prosper her Majesty’s arms,
to defend the right! We have the
Home Secretary and the Earl of Clarendon
completely subscribing to these
sentiments; but we have the Prime
Minister, who more than any other
man ought, now that war is declared,
to be imbued with hostile feelings
against Russian aggression, and determined
to carry on the war with vigour,
eternally whining after peace, and
throwing cold water on the ardour of
the people by constantly enlarging on
the horrors of war and the blessings of
peace. They say that old age is
second childhood. England seems
likely soon to become aware of this fact,
through dire experience. Her Premier,
on the Continent, is described,
and rightly so, as “the apologist of
Russia;” the Minister who is supposed
to be, more than any other, in the
confidence of his Sovereign. Talk of
explanation! The very fact of his entertaining
sentiments with regard to
Russia so ambiguous, so equivocal,
and so lenient towards the enemy of
his country, that actually in giving
expression to them he is mistaken for
offering an apology for the Czar, and
exposed to the scorn of the country
and the distrust of Europe, seems to
us to be amply sufficient to disqualify
him henceforth for ever being “the
first Minister of the first Sovereign in
the world” during the eventful period
of war; and the only charitable construction
which we can give to the passage
is, that he—our helmsman in the
storm—has entered upon his dotage,
and returned to the proverbial folly of
childhood. If his sentiments are the
result of mere folly, then he may
properly be charged with credulity;
if his friendship for the Czar regulates
his conduct, then it is connivance
for which he is answerable.
In either sense he is unfit for his office.
There may be, for aught we know—indeed
there probably are—others
in the Cabinet of the same frame of
mind. The man who could denounce
Turkey as a country full of anomalies
and inconsistencies, and endeavour
with all the force of his “sanctimonious
rhetoric” to excite an antipathy to that
State, and despair at her fate, just at
the moment when it was necessary to
rouse the people against Russian aggression,
was merely supporting the
Emperor’s theory of the “sick man,”
and cannot be said to have any definite
ideas with reference to the aggressive
policy of Russia, to check which we are
at war; or any very great sympathy
with that country to defend which we
are also at war. Here is discordancy
in the Cabinet on the most vital question;
and there is probably as much on
every other question that is brought
before the notice of the British Parliament.
Here is food for discontent and
anxiety to the people of England. Thus
may their ardour be damped and their
spirits quenched long ere the struggle
has concluded. And if we look at the
supporters of the Government—the
Ministerial party, as they are termed—there,
too, we behold the same intestine
strife. What has been the attitude
of the Manchester party with regard
to the Government?—what the
attitude of the Whig statesmen who
have been “banished to invisible corners
of the senate?”—what of the Whig
peers—such men, for example, as
Lords Grey, Clanricarde, and others?
Mr Bright and the Whig peers are
openly, though on different grounds,
hostile to the Ministerial policy, the
others scarcely less so. The Manchester
party rank amongst the regular
supporters of the Government, yet
they appeal to the Opposition to know
“whether they don’t occupy a very
absurd position” in following men who
will not lead them, and are derisively
answered in the affirmative. If they
criticise the course of the Government,
their opinion is regarded with the
“greatest indifference and contempt.”
Thus do matters stand, and yet Ministers
have the audacity to affirm that
they possess the confidence of Parliament,
and that it is the war which
prevents the success of their measures.
But is this the front which we are to
present to our foes? Are we to exhibit
to Russia, as our leaders in the
strife, a Government on sufferance notoriously
incompetent, whether at home
legislation or foreign negotiation? Is
not Conservative reascendancy the
only salvation of the country? Does
not the nation at large pant for something
like a Government—one which is
followed by a united party—one which
is at unison in itself—one of principle
and not of expediency? When we see
a Government openly hostile amongst
themselves, scorned and contemned
by the country, beaten on every point
by their opponents, obliged to withdraw
measure after measure, and retaining
one only after it, as has been
observed before, has undergone as
many metamorphoses as ever Ovid described—when
we see all this, which
we can hardly do without being roused
to feelings of indignation, it appears to
us necessary to consider how may
this be remedied, how may Russia
be firmly opposed, how may England
be rescued from the pernicious effects
of an incapable Government, and how
may unanimity be restored to the
councils of her Majesty?</p>

<p class='c009'>It is very evident, that only by the
reascendancy of the Conservative
party can these blessings be secured
to the country. The tradition of that
party is, as its name implies, the preservation
of our institutions in Church
and State. This is a definite object.
That it is a desirable one, is a conclusion
which is arrived at by one course
of reasoning, the same premises, the
same logical inferences. Hence the
Conservative party is a united band.
A Conservative Minister cannot be a
Minister on sufferance; a Whig Minister
must. The Whigs are ever desirous
of change, and the so-called
amelioration of our institutions; but
few of them agree together in the paramount
importance which attaches
to the reform of any particular abuse,
or in the amount of innovation which it
is desirable to introduce. Hence they
are always at variance with each other
when the time for action arrives; and
this incapacitates them for carrying on
the Queen’s government. If popular
enthusiasm comes to their aid, and
force them on in spite of themselves,
then the case is different. The Reform
Bill of 1832 was carried triumphantly,
but by the people. Popular
enthusiasm supplied vigour to the executive.
Contrast this with another
Reform Bill, of no very distant date,
as regards its introduction at least,
though few of the present generation
are likely to see that bill become the
law of the land. The time was unfortunate
for Whig administrators,
though backed by those who claim to
themselves the name of Conservatives.
A Russian war carried that enthusiasm,
so necessary to the Whigs, through another
channel, and exposed in a ludicrous
manner the true value of a Liberal
Administration, and their dependence
upon the popular will.
True, there was a large party in the
Senate clamorous for reform—perhaps
a majority. There was no hesitation
amongst members to conclude that
reform was necessary, for these are
liberal times. How, then, do we account
for their ill-success? By
adopting a happy description of their
worth as statesmen, given long ago:
“Their head is at fever heat, but their
hand is paralysed.” They are not
slow to adopt as their own any principle,
though calculated to throw the
country in a flame, so long as it is
traditionally the property of their
party. But when the time for action
arrives, when that principle is to be
embodied in a bill, and that theory is
to be reduced to a practical test, then
comes division and discontent. One
portion objects to this part as too
sweeping, while another declares it to
be too confined. This wants one remedy,
the other declares the wished-for
remedy will only prove an aggravation
of the malady. There is no
hesitation in adopting any principle,
however dangerous. Give them the
opportunity—the advantageous opportunity,
in the eyes of politicians—of
putting their plans into execution,
and immediately we behold irresolution,
consequent upon dissension, and
inactivity, the offspring of indecision.
Only divert the populace from them,
who, when roused, carry all before
them, as it were, and force their
leaders to bury their dissensions—only
deprive them of that support, and then
you see the intrinsic worth of your
Whig statesman. He may carry,
perhaps, one bold measure; but his
title to succeeding years of administration
rests upon the gratitude of his
supporters. He is unable to carry
those minor measures—those measures
of equal public importance, though of
a less conspicuous character—more
solid though less showy—which contribute
so much to the moral happiness
and physical enjoyment of a
great nation, and which are the pillars
of a statesman’s fame. There is
no firmness in a Whig ruler—there
cannot be, if he would reconcile and
command the confidence of all the
various sects of his followers. Who
was it that held with a firm and steady
hand the helm of England, when all
other Continental nations were submerged
in ruin? A Conservative
statesman. No Whig Minister could
have succeeded then. The utmost
firmness and steadiness in conducting
the public business of this country
were then required. No Whig Cabinet
could have guided the fortunes of
England then. Obliged to truckle
first to this man’s fancies, then to another’s
follies, they are but a faithful
index of the dissension amongst their
followers, and uncertainty and irresolution
are sure to follow. Yet to such
as these are our fortunes, in times so
perilous as our own, committed; and
already are the baneful effects visible.
If the Conservative party were to
pursue the course which the Opposition
of former days is known to have
taken, what would be the position of
the Government? If their opponents
were not to support them in the war,
the conduct of it would be in the same
position as all the other measures
which they have brought forward this
session, and for the success of which
they are dependent upon their followers.
Such a state of affairs may continue
for a time, but it must eventually
call down the indignation of the
country. No wonder that the conduct
of our Government constantly gives
rise to the suspicion that they are too
desirous for the cessation of hostilities.
It is manifestly their interest so to
appear, if it be not also so to act. A
peace, even though it were merely an
armed truce, would satisfy the cravings
of many of their followers; and
probably the belief that such may be
obtained, renders them less disagreeable
to the Government than they
would otherwise have proved themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>Never, perhaps, was the inability
of the Whig party to govern exhibited
in such a marked manner as at the
period immediately succeeding the
passing of the Reform Bill. With a
majority of three hundred, they yet
disagreed amongst themselves concerning
the desirability of introducing
innovations into the Irish Church, and
they fell. Some have declared that
an excess of power—a majority too
large to manage—was fatal to the endurance
of their power. We rather
think that it was but a conclusive
proof that a Whig Minister <em>must</em> be a
Minister on sufferance—in other words,
is unable to govern. Unhappily for
themselves, at the period to which we
are alluding, a rather more important
question than usual occasioned the
schism. Those who disagreed did not
merely, as generally happens in these
cases, hold aloof for a time, embarrass
the Government, and then return to
their allegiance, but they went at
once into open hostility. They retired
to swell the Conservative ranks. This
is a specimen, on an exaggerated
scale perhaps, of what is constantly
occurring when a Whig Ministry is in
power. For what do we see now?
We behold the Conservative party
united in their opinions with regard
to Russian aggression upon Turkey.
In the Ministerial host there is nothing,
as usual, but dissension and
endless disagreement. The Manchester
party condemns the war and everything
belonging to it. The Peelites
evidently look with a cold eye upon
it; they believe not in the vitality of
Turkey, or in the danger of Russian
aggrandisement. So far there is
agreement between these sects. They
cannot, however, form one party, for
there is disagreement between them
on vital points connected with Home
administration. Then, again, there
are the philosophical Radicals demanding
the Ballot, while the aristocratic
Whigs most properly declare that secret
voting shall never become one of the
institutions of the country. In short,
the Ministerial camp is split up into
various and opposing sects, which are
continually warring with each other,
while the Cabinet itself is but another
scene of this general medley and confusion,
this discontent and convulsion;
and its executive power is paralysed
by internal discord. The introduction
of the Peelites amongst the Whigs has
but increased the differences in the
camp. Never was there a time when
the internal dissensions of a Ministerial
host were so marked, so wide-spreading,
or so notorious. And this,
too, at this critical time, when England
ought especially to be calm and
tranquil within, in order to be able to
consider well what are her interests
without. Is this to continue? Are
the interests of England and Europe
to be jeopardied by the continuance in
power of a Ministry so divided and so
weak? It is, we think, a truly logical
inference that the fall of the Coalition,
and the reascendancy of the Conservative
party, is the only method by
which an end can be put to that constant
strife, and unanimity restored to
the councils of our Sovereign. In a time
of war, it is of the last importance
that a Ministry should be united and
firm, and possessed of the confidence
of the country. Every one will probably
admit this; but, then, does the
Coalition answer to this description?</p>

<p class='c009'>It is idle to pursue this subject
further. No one who really wishes
well to his country in this emergency,
can say that it is to the present Government
that we ought to confide the
direction of our affairs, unless he be
dazzled by the undoubted splendour
of their names. There are, doubtless,
great talents amongst them; but there
is such a thing as the utmost danger
in a superfluity of talent, particularly
when applied to pursuits to which
they are not especially adapted. Too
much collective talent begets an overweening
self-confidence, and lessens
the sense of responsibility; moreover,
if this too great self-confidence be
brought to bear its influence in the
direction of affairs of which one is
ignorant, no beneficial result is to be
expected. Again, if all these misdirected
and misapplied talents be
controlled by an incapable chief, can
it be said that their administrative
abilities are placed at service of the
country? No! personal pique and
private considerations prevent it. We
need not dwell upon the incapability
of the First Lord of the Treasury,
which is now generally admitted. We
now look to the other prominent members
of the Government. The office
assigned to Lord Palmerston is the
most notoriously incongruous. With
a world-wide reputation for his administration
of our foreign affairs,
gained in an experience of them for
sixteen years, his lordship is placed
in an office where he may exercise
his negotiative powers with county
magistrates, town constables, and the
like. There he is—the most popular
Foreign Secretary of the day, the man
in whom the country has perhaps as
great a confidence as in any one,
engaged in squabbles over town police,
graveyards, sewers, and the rest.
Lord Palmerston cannot be said to
be at home in his office. The country
is disposed to look with favour upon
him on account of his great name and
services; but does he really make a
better Home Secretary than Mr Walpole?
Why was he not transferred
to the War Office on its creation, with
his extensive knowledge of European
affairs? If the interests of the country
had been consulted, undoubtedly he
would; but again private considerations
were opposed to the national
will and the public weal; and the
Duke of Newcastle, who has as yet
no claims to public confidence, is
placed in an office to which, on the
formation of the Government, it cannot
be said that he was assigned.
Again, there is Sir George Grey, who
is adapted more especially to the
Home Office, if to any; but, “being
more remarkable for his private virtues
than his administrative abilities,”
is certainly not the man to be unceremoniously
pitchforked into an office
with which he has no acquaintance,
other than the little he is supposed
to have learnt during the “disastrous
administration of Lord Glenelg.” If
there are talents here—if there is
experience here—as in Lord Palmerston’s
case, so in this; the experience
is rendered nothing worth, and the
talents misapplied. It is unnecessary
to dilate further upon this subject;
let us look at the blessings derived to
the country from the administrative
abilities of those whose talents have
not been misdirected. There is our
gifted Chancellor of the Exchequer,
who has made more mistakes within
a given time than any of his predecessors
in the past century; and when
we remember that financial blunders
are national misfortunes, it is no matter
of wonder that people refuse to
regard him with an eye of favour,
even though we overlook the probable
pernicious effects of his Tractarian
tendencies over the Church of England,
felt through his influence over
the disposal of the Church patronage.
How long will England, dazzled by
names, overlook facts and their consequences?
Divest the members of
the Government of their previous reputation,
of their great names—give
them names unknown to the country,
and what language sufficiently strong
would be found to apply to such an
incapable Administration, with all
their blunders, their dissensions, and
their disastrous speculations? Had
Lord Derby and his colleagues committed
half the blunders of this
Cabinet—had they attempted to tamper
recklessly with our finances—had
they involved us in a war
which might have been avoided by
sufficient plain-speaking in negotiation,
what would their opponents
have said? Would we have witnessed
the patriotic course which we have
seen the Opposition of the present day
adopt? Few would suppose it, when
they recall to mind the undignified
hurry which the Opposition manifested
for office during the brief period
which elapsed between the assembling
of Parliament in November 1852 and
the Christmas vacation—a restlessness
which induced them all to combine
together, Whig, Radical, and Peelite,
High Church and Dissent, in order to
overthrow the Administration of the
day; while their unredeemed compact
with the Roman Catholics will not
easily be forgotten. Few would suppose
it, when they recall to mind the
course adopted by the Whig Opposition
during the last war, when, for
factious purposes, victories were represented
as defeats, the movements of
the British general rendered the battlefield
of party strife at home, and the
motions of the Government clogged by
the hands of unprincipled and factious
opponents. Few would suppose it,
when they recollect that Whig alacrity
to accept office is only equalled by
Conservative disdain to hold it on sufferance.
But what was the conduct
of the Government of Lord Derby?
Is not that Government now admitted
to have been the instrument of more
good to the country, in its short tenure
of office, than was ever effected by
any of its predecessors within so short
a time? And if we remember the
immense amount of opposition which
was brought to bear against it; that,
in the first few months of its existence,
the completion of the business of Parliament,
previous to its dissolution,
was all that was expected or required
at its hands; that, after the dissolution,
a majority of nineteen effected,
though with the greatest difficulty,
the overthrow of the Administration,
without allowing the smallest time for
the trial of their legislative powers,
it must be admitted that the members
of that Conservative Government, in
the face of the greatest difficulties,
exhibited administrative abilities of a
high order. They were unable, from
circumstances, to take advantage, like
their successors, of the tide of popular
favour which in these days is sure to
run in the direction of a new Administration,
because they were only
expected to wind up, as quickly as
they could, the Parliamentary business
of the session. Yet to them may
be traced the advantages we possessed
in preparation for the present war.
They were the first Government who
dared to come down to the British
House of Commons, and tell it the
national defences were insecure, and
demand the means of placing England
in a position to resist any threatened
invasion. Do we not owe to them
the establishment of our militia? Was
not that a bill than which none has
been more perfect in its details, or
more universally satisfactory to the
country? Do we not owe to them the
establishment of our Channel Fleet on
such a footing that it secured England
from all aggression? Then was laid
the basis of that splendid fleet which
a few months back left our shores for
the Baltic Sea. Again, it is to their
prescience that we can trace the advantages
which are derived to ourselves,
and to the cause of civilisation
and independence, from our present
amicable relations with France. Did
they not, in opposition to the popular
will, unequivocally expressed, and in
the face of the utmost censure of the
press, persist in cultivating the friendship
of France? To that firmness and
political sagacity we trace the advantages
we derive from having so powerful
a friend by whose side to fight in
the cause of Europe. Contrast this
with the conduct of that brilliant Administration
which was to rescue England
from the evil position into which
it was brought by the reckless Derby
Government, and what do we find?
Two members of that Government, immediately
on taking office, commence
their abuse of the French Emperor in
no measured terms. Nor is this all:
Their brilliant opponent, who was naturally
desirous to bring such a glaring
indiscretion before the notice of the
Commons of England, was charged
by the triumphant Coalition with
having a mind deeply imbued with
faction. The like absence of political
sagacity is observable throughout the
whole course of the Government. With
a war staring us in the face, which
ought to have appeared almost inevitable
to the Government, with their superior
information and knowledge of
facts, the Chancellor of the Exchequer
brings forward a Peace Budget, parting
with an important item in our revenue.
This was another blow levelled against
the agricultural interest through the
indiscretion of the Government, for it
resulted in soap being relieved at the
expense of malt. Our discreet Chancellor
parts with a quantity of revenue
derived from indirect taxation one
year, and redeems his blunder the
next by levying an increased tax on
malt. But what are we to expect
from a Chancellor of the Exchequer
whose administration of the finances
has been one continued system of
blunders? The secret lies in this:
All his various failings arise from his
having entered upon schemes in which,
as he proceeded, he soon found himself
out of his depth. Another minister
would have been deterred from
entering upon them, from a sense of the
responsibility he would incur. But
when a Ministry fancies it contains
within itself all the available administrative
talent in the Empire, the sense
of responsibility is lightened, because
opponents are undervalued, and self-confidence
augmented. Here, again,
do all the other misdemeanours of the
Cabinet take their origin. Confident
in themselves, and in their fancied
influence over Parliament, they bring
forward, in the face of war, a larger
number of important measures than
ever before were introduced to Parliament
in the same session. They
only exhibited their own weakness.
They proved that their plans of legislation
differ materially from those of
the House of Commons. They discovered
that even all the talents cannot
blunder with impunity, and they
have rapidly sunk in public estimation.
Their conduct has disgusted their followers,
and provoked a powerful opposition.
Their numerous indiscretions
would certainly not have been tolerated
in any men but our talented
rulers in the Coalition; and even they
are suffering from the effects of their
rashness, but nevertheless seem determined
to “survive in office the honour
of their administration.” Referring,
again, to the Derby Government
of 1852, we ask if the Earl of
Malmesbury, or any two important
members of that Administration, had
been afflicted with a like absence of
political sagacity to that displayed by
Sir James Graham and Sir Charles
Wood, where would have been our relations
with France? If that Government
had, for the sake of the popularity
which Sir James Graham values
so much, but which no Minister has
been so unfortunate in his attempt to
gain, joined in the temporary popular
resentment against the French Emperor,
when would the breach have been
healed? But <em>they</em> showed that they
understood the interests of the country,
and contrast in a favourable light
with the members of the Coalition and
their misdeeds. They evidently were
aware of the deep responsibility under
which they lay, and thus their actions
were marked with a caution which is
not observed by their successors. If
Mr Disraeli had not handed over a
large balance to his rival, what would
have been the effect of the failure of
his schemes? It comes to this, then:
The forethought and prudence of the
Derby Government have only had the
effect of shielding the Coalition from
the worst consequences of their indiscretions
and total failures, and enabling
the country to withstand the
mal-administration of its present
rulers, instead of being improved and
brought to be of permanent advantage
to the nation. It may, however, be
thought to be a great drawback to
Conservative reascendancy, that the
leaders of that great party are, for
the most part, comparatively inexperienced
in office. However that
may be, the administration of ten
months’ duration stands out in broad
relief between its predecessor and the
Coalition; at all events, it would be
difficult for them to commit more
blunders than the present talented
and <em>experienced</em> Administration. But
can a charge of inability be fairly
urged against a party which contains
within its ranks men of such talent,
parliamentary experience, and sagacity
as the Earl of Derby, Lord St
Leonards, Lord Eglinton, Disraeli,
Walpole, Thesiger, Kelly, Pakington,
Malmesbury, Bulwer Lytton, Stanley,
Manners, and the other Conservative
statesmen? The year 1852 must, in
the eyes of thinking men, for ever dispel
such an imputation. The same
party which, shorn of its leaders in
1846, yet sent forward to maintain its
cause in that “sad fierce session” its
champions in debate, so many and so
powerful as to astonish its foes and
restore spirit amongst its ranks, produced
also, in time of need, statesmen
whose official career, short though it
was, does no discredit to their followers—the
gentlemen of England.
The chiefs in either House, in particular,
are men of brilliant talent and
tried sagacity. Trained in the Liberal
ranks, it may be presumed that they
are deeply convinced of the danger of
continually seeking after that phantom,
which, the nearer we approach,
the farther it recedes—viz., a system
of representation which shall do justice
to all parties in the State; while,
at the same time, that very training
has divested them of that spirit of exclusion,
and that horror of anything
approaching to innovation, which were
the chief imputations against the Toryism
of bygone times, but which do
not accord with the intelligence of the
present age. The Earl of Derby, as
every one knows, was a member of
that Cabinet which secured the reform
of Parliament. He has since been
engaged in endeavouring, and not unsuccessfully,
to stem the tide of democracy
which then set in. For that
end he joined Sir Robert Peel—for
that end he left him. Mr Disraeli,
too, awakening to a full sense of the
danger which “the youthful energies
of Radicalism” are too well calculated
to produce, became a decided Conservative,
though not a bigoted exclusionist.
To these principles he has
steadily adhered in the whole course
of his parliamentary career, which has
now spread over a term of seventeen
years. No man needs to stand higher
in the estimation of his party than
does the member for Buckinghamshire.
Gifted with talents which
fall to the lot of but few, possessed of
keen sagacity, indomitable resolution,
and extensive knowledge, he has never
shrunk from placing at the service of
his country, and of the great party of
which he is the recognised chieftain,
the utmost efforts of his admired and
envied genius. Where is the man
who has more unflinchingly stood by
his party at all seasons, both of adversity
and prosperity? His rapid
elevation has, no doubt, been viewed
by many with feelings of dissatisfaction;

      <div class='line'>“Envy does merit, as its shade, pursue.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>It is evident that he has also many
personal enemies. The man who overthrew
a Government which many supposed
would have continued during
the lifetime of its leader, and even
have survived him, is not likely to be
regarded with any especial favour by
the members of that Cabinet. The
uncompromising hostility which he
bore to them has roused their utmost indignation,
and his character has been
unsparingly attacked. Some have had
the sagacity to detect the cloven hoof
in every step which he has made in
public life; nor has he been allowed
by them to possess the smallest particle
of political virtue, and “one of
the humblest individuals of this vast
empire” has thought fit to embody his
views of the political career of Mr
Disraeli in a somewhat bulky volume,
where he has given vent to his holy
indignation. Such a production would
have been a disgrace to the age, even
if the author had had the courage to
place his name at the head of it, for it
is introducing into party warfare a
weapon which is most unfair, unjust,
and dishonourable. No statesman
can condescend to notice such an
attack; and when the author withholds
his name and sends forth his
anonymous slander into the world, then
it must be confessed that the cowardly
spirit in which it has been undertaken
has only aggravated its revolting
character.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr Disraeli is an original genius.
His great fault in early life was, that
he formed his conclusions without deep
study, and trusting chiefly to the
power of his own intellect. With all
the conceit and precipitancy of youth,
he immediately gave forth to the
world the conclusions at which he had
arrived. Many of these were wild
and improbable, and his maturer
years discovered their true nature.
His father was, as is well known, a
Jew, while his ancestors were, down
to a recent period, the natives of a
foreign soil. The son, then, inherited
no hereditary political principles, which
are in England, generally, handed
down from one generation to another,
unchanging and unchanged. Mr Disraeli
had therefore to choose for himself,
from the wide field of English
politics, those principles which appeared
to his unbiassed mind most in
accordance with the true spirit of the
British constitution. The choice which
he adopted, and the subsequent changes
through which he passed, appear to us
to be nothing but the natural workings
of an unfettered mind, and which
any man may, and probably often
does, undergo, as he ponders over the
English constitution and the science
of government in the recesses of his
own study. It is natural that, as an
Englishman contemplates our form of
government, as he becomes acquainted
with its operations, and as he compares
its results with reference to the mind,
the habits, and the temper of the people
with the influence of Continental
governments over their subjects, he
should be filled with admiration at the
wonderful manner in which the united
harmonious action of the Three Estates
of the realm is secured; and his first
thought is, that it must be preserved
unimpaired and inviolate. As he proceeds,
he finds blemishes, anomalies,
and imperfections; these he concludes
should be eradicated, and with all the
ardour of youth he thinks that, once
these disappear, a form of government
remains complete in its splendour, and
splendid in its completeness. A wider
intercourse with the world, a more
extensive knowledge of mankind,
must dissipate in many minds this
perhaps fondly-cherished sentiment.
Perfection cannot be attained—contentment
is never the lot of humanity;
and perhaps it is better that each
should endeavour to forget his particular
object of antipathy, and unite in
consolidating and preserving those
institutions, with their many imperfections,
than hazard their extinction by
endless struggles after their purification.
Are not these legitimate changes
of opinion? A man who has thus
formed his political opinions, remains
a staunch Conservative, but eschews
all those more repulsive features of
Toryism, which do but defeat their own
end, and raise up against itself, in
power too strong to be resisted, the
very influences it wishes to control
and counteract. But what shall we
say of a young man who thinks
fit, in the impetuous ardour of his
ambition, to publish to the world
his opinions as they are forming?
We may smile at the vanity displayed,
and at the folly of such a
course; but we may shrink from casting
imputations and urging motives,
from which a virtuous mind recoils,
for the mere purpose of blackening
and traducing the character of a political
opponent. Such, however, is
the course pursued by Mr Disraeli’s
enemies; but we should think that
the strong malevolence displayed in
those satires and slanders must insure
their being discarded by “all in whom
political partisanship has not extinguished
the common feelings of humanity.”
It is said that Mr Disraeli’s
changes of opinion were with a view
to self-aggrandisement. The charge,
we presume, rests upon the pretence
that he was the better for each change.
This may be; but we think an ardent,
clever, and ambitious man like Mr
Disraeli, would have risen to eminence
whatever line of politics he adopted.
It was not more difficult for him to
get into Parliament as a Radical than
as a Tory; indeed, this seems to be
unwittingly allowed by his biographer
when he states that his election for
High Wycombe was lost because Mr
Hume withdrew his support in consequence
of Mr Disraeli’s refusing to
compromise his opinions with regard
to the Whigs. It is, however, a decidedly
unfair course to rake together
all that has fallen from an aspiring
and even giddy youth, no matter
whether in the heat of political contest
or in the turmoil of an election strife,
and then call him in his maturity to a
severe account. No charitable construction
is ever allowed to Mr Disraeli’s
public acts. It is always easy
to get up a colourable case against an
English statesman, all whose acts lay
bare before the eager gaze of the public.
It requires the exercising of very
little ingenuity to hang together a
consistent string of facts with which
to stigmatise with baseness the career
of any politician, however brilliant in
talent or in character. Mr Disraeli
has risen from the people; he has excited
the envy of some and the hatred
of others, who indulge their vengeful
feelings in spreading their malicious
slanders; nor is the most stainless
character proof against such assaults,
since they can quickly acquire a consistency
of character, and gain a hold
on men’s minds when they are dinned
into one’s ears on all sides. How
easy it might be to make up a case of
political profligacy against Sir James
Graham, who has been through more
political changes, and that, too, since
he was a representative of the people,
than any other statesman of the day!
How easy it might be to discern in
this the workings of a restless ambition!
A colourable case is soon made, and
then let a certain number of newspapers
indulge in comments upon it,
and spread the calumnies, each in his
own strain, and all spiced with a little
outpouring of virtuous indignation,
and the best character is sure to be
injured by it. There are some in
these charitable times who can defend
a Cromwell; we apprehend that with
far less exercise of ingenuity can the
character of the Conservative leader
be maintained. But if it be true that
Cromwell is not the remorseless villain
which his history had depicted him,
then it only shows how easily characters
can be fatally blackened by constantly
harping on the evil points, and quietly
omitting all mention of the good.</p>

<p class='c009'>Throughout the whole parliamentary
career of Mr Disraeli, a consistent
course of conduct with reference
to State policy has been pursued;
though it is observable that, in the first
few years, he had not yet thrown
away some of his extraordinary theories.
We see that, as he advances
in manhood, and becomes practically
acquainted with legislation, the vain
conceptions and egotistic vanity of his
youth pass away, and he settles down
into a steady, through-going, parliamentary
chief. The different opinions
which he has at times expressed
of various statesmen are easily to be
accounted for, though some who, as
the poet says, judge of others by themselves,
may discern in this discreditable
motives. Public opinion is always
varying with regard to public
men, and a young man is likely to be
influenced by it. But, at all events,
he ought, through motives of modesty,
to keep his opinion to himself; and it
is of the greatest importance that one
who aspires to be a statesman in this
country, where parties are always
changing, should not be constantly
giving expression to the feelings of the
moment. It is not safe for a politician;
for while he is giving vent to
what is generally a mere fancied animosity
to the mere party-feeling of
the moment, he may perhaps be throwing
down the gauntlet at the feet of a
future colleague; and all for no purpose,
for oftentimes there is no foundation
for aversion to a public man.
Nor is it right that the House of
Commons, our country, and Continental
nations, should be constantly hearing
statesmen mutually complimenting
and abusing each other. It is a
maxim in State policy that you should
deal with your enemy as though one
day he may be your friend, and <em>vice
versâ</em>. In private life, it happens that
one who is a friend may first be viewed
with coolness, and then treated as an
enemy; and this change in conduct
may be legitimate, though not creditable.
Still more frequently may this
happen in public life. Mr Disraeli
has, we should think, learnt from
bitter experience the folly of giving
expression to mere transient feelings
either of anger or respect. He is a
man of extremes; he knows no mediocrity
of feeling; witness the inflated
style of the soliloquies in his novels,
which have drawn down upon him the
unmitigated ire of his zealous biographer.
With him a statesman’s career
is either “a system of petty larceny
on a great scale,” or it is “a precious
possession of the House of Commons.”
This is a pity; but Mr Disraeli, unlike
other statesmen, had not in early
life the friendship of those who had
trodden the thorny paths of English
politics before him, to inculcate upon
him the necessity of being habitually
reserved and moderate in his expressions;
and neither reserve nor moderation
forms a part of his natural
character. Too warm a nature,
or too ardent a temperament are
not discreditable, though they often
bring pain and trouble along with
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>We now come to the most hackneyed,
and, we admit, the most painful
portion of Mr Disraeli’s life—his
treatment of Sir Robert Peel.</p>

<p class='c009'>But these things belong to the past.
Great blame, in the eyes of an impartial
observer, may be attached to Peel
for the course he then took, and great
blame may also attach to Disraeli;
much, on the other hand, may be said
in palliation of the conduct of both.
The one has long ago been forgiven
by the great party which he irreparably
injured; the other will, we firmly
believe, prove himself, at no distant
period, as firm and enlightened a Minister
as he is now one of the most
talented and accomplished statesmen
that ever adorned with his eloquence,
or controlled by his wisdom,
the legislation of the British Parliament.</p>

<p class='c009'>We now conclude by urging the
necessity there is for the reascendancy
of the Conservative party. We are
evidently on the verge of a momentous
period. Are we to commit the guidance
of our affairs to a Government
whose conduct, as yet, has been one
course of bungling—the result of dissension,
of abortive speculations—the
result of a misplaced self-confidence,
and of unsuccessful negotiation—the
result of an infatuated love of peace?
We make, then, our appeal to the
Protestants of England; are we any
longer to truckle to the Pope of Rome—are
we still to devote the public
money to the support of Roman Catholic
priests, and then call it “religious
bigotry?” We make our appeal
to the friends of Turkey amongst
us: are we to have a Ministry in
power who are divided in their opinions
concerning the vitality of the
country which we are desirous of protecting,
and amongst whose supporters
are men who deny our right to go
to war at all? We make our appeal
to the foes of Russia; shall we have
a Premier who declares that “what
is called the security of Europe” has
nothing to fear from Russian aggression,
and then says that he has nothing
to retract or explain? Let us
have a Ministry of able men, united
amongst themselves, prepared to uphold
our Protestant religion, agreed
upon the vitality of Turkey, resolved
to resist Russia, determined to secure
a durable peace; and, above all, one
that is strong in the confidence of the
country, and supported by a united
majority. Let us tear down the emblems
of the most incapable and mischief-making
Coalition that ever any
country was cursed with, and proclaim
over its fall the reascendancy of Conservative
principles.</p>

to 1646</cite>, by Thomas Crawford, printed in 1808 from a MS. of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p class='c009'><a href='#r30'>30</a>. As a single sample of these excavations, we may mention one made at Portelette,
on the Somme. At a depth of nine feet, a large quantity of bones was met with; and
one foot lower, a piece of deer’s horn, bearing marks of human workmanship. At
twenty feet from the surface, and <em>five feet below the level of the present bed of the river</em>,
three axes, highly finished, and in perfect preservation, were turned up in a bed of turf.
Some axe-cases of stag’s horn were also discovered in the same bed. Near these was
a coarse vase of black pottery, very much broken, and surrounded with a black mass
of decomposed pottery; and also large quantities of wrought bones, both human and
animal.</p>

Ireland; with a Verification of the River-Ocean of the Greeks</cite>. M‘Glashan, Dublin,
1851.</p>

<p class='c009'><a href='#r32'>32</a>. It is not improbable that the old feudal law, which placed the person of a female
vassal at the disposal of the seigneur on her wedding-night, originated in political
motives as well as in a tyrannous sensuality.</p>
